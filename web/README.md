This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you want to view the issues' dynamic routing, then you will have to add another line to your .env file like so:
```"URL" = http://localhost:3000```

Make sure to run ``` npm install``` after every pull. If we continue to use Ant Design, you may have to append a --legacy-peer-deps to the install

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
