Congressman Davis' top priority in Congress is expanding access to affordable health care because he knows it is vital to keeping rural hospitals open, making health care accessible to those who need it most, and improving treatment for victims of addiction.
Congressman Davis is leading the effort in the House to expand access to affordable care for  North Carolinians. That's why a few of his first official acts in Congress included cosponsoring H.R. 31 COVER Now Act, which would help find a federal alternative to states who have yet to expand Medicaid and relaunching the State Medicaid Expansion Caucus (SMEC) to advance solutions to expand Medicaid for those trapped in their state's coverage gap.
Congressman Davis understands that residents across North Carolina's First Congressional District sometimes must choose between purchasing their lifesaving medication and putting food on the table. The hardworking people of eastern North Carolina make up more than 20 percent of the state, and he is doing what he can to keep them safe and healthy.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Don Davis (D-NC) and U.S. Representative Don Bacon (R-NE) introduced H.R. 2973, the Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act , which ensures U.S. Coast Guard veterans receive the full benefits they earned through their service. The legislation would close a loophole in an existing law that failed to provide U.S. Coast Guard servicemembers with the same tax break afforded to other active duty personnel.
“It is essential that we prioritize the well-being of our U.S. Coast Guard combat-injured veterans, closing this loophole and ensuring they receive full benefits,” said Congressman Don Davis. “We must not stop advocating passionately for our U.S. Coast Guard veterans, who have devoted their lives to serving our country. Together, we must work to ensure no veteran is left behind.”
“In 2016, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act returned taxes that were improperly withheld from combat-injured veterans of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. However, Coast Guard personnel injured while serving in combat were not included in that legislation,” said Congressman Bacon. “The Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act would ensure that combat-injured Coast Guard veterans receive their full benefits as combat-injured veterans in their sister services and will prevent similar oversight in the future.”
Without H.R. 2973 Coast Guard veterans are not able to access the same tax refund on disability severance payments.
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that there were 130,000 non-U.S. Coast Guard veterans eligible for an estimated $280 million in tax refunds for disability severance payments.
As of 2023, there are an estimated 4,860 U.S. Coast Guard veterans with service-connected disabilities, who may be eligible for an estimated $11 million in refunds.
However, many of the veterans had taxes withheld. The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016 remedies that. The law directed the U.S. Secretary of Defense to identify disability severance payments paid after Jan. 17, 1991, that were included as taxable income. The 2016 law required the U.S. Secretary of Defense to notify servicemembers about their eligibility for tax refunds under that law, but it left out ex-U.S. Coast Guard personnel. Therefore, H.R. 2973 expands the tax refund eligibility to former members of the Coast Guard by closing a loophole that made them ineligible for such benefits.
The deadline to file for the refund is one year from the date of the U.S. Defense Department notice, or three years after the due date for filing the original return for the year the disability severance payment was made, or two years after the tax was paid for the year the disability severance payment was made, according to the IRS.
Congressman Don Davis serves as the vice ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee and sits on the Subcommittees on Tactical Air and Land Forces and Readiness. He graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1994 and is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Don Davis (D-NC) and U.S. Representative Don Bacon (R-NE) introduced H.R. 2973, the Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act , which ensures U.S. Coast Guard veterans receive the full benefits they earned through their service. The legislation would close a loophole in an existing law that failed to provide U.S. Coast Guard servicemembers with the same tax break afforded to other active duty personnel.
“It is essential that we prioritize the well-being of our U.S. Coast Guard combat-injured veterans, closing this loophole and ensuring they receive full benefits,” said Congressman Don Davis. “We must not stop advocating passionately for our U.S. Coast Guard veterans, who have devoted their lives to serving our country. Together, we must work to ensure no veteran is left behind.”
“In 2016, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act returned taxes that were improperly withheld from combat-injured veterans of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. However, Coast Guard personnel injured while serving in combat were not included in that legislation,” said Congressman Bacon. “The Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act would ensure that combat-injured Coast Guard veterans receive their full benefits as combat-injured veterans in their sister services and will prevent similar oversight in the future.”
Without H.R. 2973 Coast Guard veterans are not able to access the same tax refund on disability severance payments.
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that there were 130,000 non-U.S. Coast Guard veterans eligible for an estimated $280 million in tax refunds for disability severance payments.
As of 2023, there are an estimated 4,860 U.S. Coast Guard veterans with service-connected disabilities, who may be eligible for an estimated $11 million in refunds.
However, many of the veterans had taxes withheld. The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016 remedies that. The law directed the U.S. Secretary of Defense to identify disability severance payments paid after Jan. 17, 1991, that were included as taxable income. The 2016 law required the U.S. Secretary of Defense to notify servicemembers about their eligibility for tax refunds under that law, but it left out ex-U.S. Coast Guard personnel. Therefore, H.R. 2973 expands the tax refund eligibility to former members of the Coast Guard by closing a loophole that made them ineligible for such benefits.
The deadline to file for the refund is one year from the date of the U.S. Defense Department notice, or three years after the due date for filing the original return for the year the disability severance payment was made, or two years after the tax was paid for the year the disability severance payment was made, according to the IRS.

Washington, D.C. — Congressman Don Davis (NC-01) introduced H.R. 2929, the Haliwa Saponi Indian Tribe of North Carolina Act , legislation that extends the full measure of the federal government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Haliwa Saponi Indian Tribe. This bill represents a step forward in the recognition and support of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe, which has long been a vital part of North Carolina's cultural heritage.
"The Haliwa Saponi Indian Tribe deserves federal recognition, and we must respect their deep-rooted heritage and vibrant traditions. We must validate the historical significance and pay tribute to their ongoing contributions," said Congressman Don Davis. "Their rich legacy, intertwined with incredible ancestral stories, truly merits the honor of federal recognition."
Congressman Davis introduced this legislation during the 60th Annual Haliwa Saponi Tribal Powwow , a vibrant celebration of the Tribe’s heritage, culture, and community spirit. Congressman Davis joined community leaders and members of the Tribe in celebrating this significant milestone.
“This is truly another historic moment for our Tribe, and we are so grateful,” said Dr. Brucie Ogletree Richardson, Chief of the Haliwa Saponi Indian Tribe. “We are thankful for the continued support of Congressman Don Davis and others who have helped our Tribe reach this milestone.”
The Tribe has over 4,000 members and resides in eastern North Carolina, where its strong relationship with its non-Indian neighbors stretches back countless generations. Halifax and Warren Counties strongly support full federal recognition for the Tribe.
“This is a historic moment for our Tribe, and we are so grateful to Congressman Don Davis and for the support of Halifax and Warren counties,” said Gideon Lee, Chairman of the Haliwa Saponi Indian Tribe . “Our forefathers have waited for this moment for a long, long time.”
Congressman Davis’ legislation ensures that the historic North Carolina American Indian Tribe will finally be treated equally under federal law with other federally recognized American Indian tribes in other parts of the country.
