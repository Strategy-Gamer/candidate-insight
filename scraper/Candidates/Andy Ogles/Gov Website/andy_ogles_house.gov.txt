WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Andy Ogles (TN-05) reintroduced the Ending Chemical Abortions Act of 2025 , a bill that would federally block the use of chemical abortions in the United States. Rep. Ogles originally introduced this legislation in September 2023 for the 118th Congress.
Congressman Ogles said , “Chemical abortions not only end a human life but pose a serious risk to the lives of the mothers. The FDA has failed to protect women and unborn children for over 20 years. In 2021, it went even further and eliminated the in-person dispensing requirement. This decision has led to an overwhelming increase in chemical abortion-related ER visits, health complications, and even deaths. It’s a tragedy that the Biden Administration and the FDA would put their radical pro-choice agenda ahead of the health and safety of women and girls across the country. I’m taking a stand against the irresponsibility of the Democrats and working to protect women and girls across America. I’m taking a stand for life because, born or unborn, every single person is uniquely and wonderfully made. It's not merely a political issue; it's a moral duty to uphold the sanctity of life. I am committed to safeguarding the innocent and voiceless in our society.”
“The abortion radicals in the Biden Administration, while claiming to care about the environment, actually allow chemically tainted placenta tissue, blood, and human remains to be flushed into our waterways, where plant, animal, and aquatic life are exposed to what remains. The pills are clearly deadly to the preborn and exceptionally harmful to women. In fact, Students for Life of America and SFLAction have prioritized ending exposure to the killing metabolites in Chemical Abortion pills, which have four times the rate of injury and ten times the death rate of surgical abortions, which are also deadly. Also troubling, during the Clinton, Obama, and Biden Administration, no FDA or EPA environmental assessments were completed to ensure that dumping human remains was not a hazard to all life. Not even hospitals or brick-and-mortar abortion vendors can get away with that.” - Kristan Hawkins, President of Students for Life
“We applaud Representative Ogles’ leadership on “The Ending Chemical Abortions Act of 2023.”  Chemical abortions fail at an alarming rate, putting women and the unborn child at risk of a second abortion procedure. The Abortion Survivors Network is committed to serving survivors of abortion at any gestational age, along with their mothers, who deserve compassionate prenatal and postpartum care, a delivery plan, and emotional support.  Let us continue to work together to ensure survivors and their families receive the best medical and emotional care possible. We look forward to continuing our work with Congressman Ogles and others who support this bill.” - Melissa Ohden, President and CEO of The Abortion Survivors Network.

WASHINGTON, DC – On Monday, Congressman Andy Ogles (TN-05) led several of his Republican House colleagues in introducing the Make Greenland Great Again Act, which would direct Congress to support President Trump’s negotiations with Denmark to acquire Greenland immediately. The United States’ ownership of the Danish territory would allow for the advancement of American economic interests and national security priorities. “The acquisition of Greenland by the United States is essential to our national security. Joe Biden took a blowtorch to our reputation these past four years, and before even taking office, President Trump is telling the world that America First is back. American economic and security interests will no longer take a backseat, and House Republicans are ready to help President Trump deliver for the American people. That’s why I introduced the Make Greenland Great Again Act,” said Congressman Ogles. “We have a mandate to help President Trump execute his America First agenda, which is one of the reasons I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. Greenland, becoming part of the US, would not only provide a strategic military advantage and boost the American economy but also benefit the residents of Greenland,” said Congresswoman Harshbarger. “Greenland and the United States already enjoy a strong, mutually beneficial relationship that includes the presence of our Pituffik air base. The United States is well positioned both physically and strategically to protect Greenland and encourage economic growth that will benefit both Americans and Greenlanders. We in Congress are encouraged by President Trump’s vision of a stronger relationship between Greenland and the United States by offering to put forth a proposal to acquire Greenland and are eager to pave the way by providing official congressional authorization to do so. I’d like to thank Congressman Ogles for leading this initiative and look forward to supporting President Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland,” said Congressman Dunn. “Securing Greenland is critical to advancing America’s national security and economic interests. Four years of failed leadership under Joe Biden weakened our position on the global stage, but President Trump is once again putting America First. This legislation ensures we take bold steps to protect our future and send a clear message that the United States will lead with strength and strategy. I’m proud to support President Trump’s efforts by co-sponsoring the Make Greenland Great Again Act,” said Congressman Moore. “Does anyone regret the Louisiana Purchase or the acquisition of Alaska? The acquisition of Greenland represents a bold and essential expansion of American interests, one that would restore national pride and optimism to a country demoralized by the disastrous policies of the past four years under the Biden Administration. President Trump’s vision for Greenland is exactly what is needed to reignite the spirit of Manifest Destiny that once propelled Americans to greatness. A historic presidency deserves a historic beginning. Let’s Make Greenland Great Again!” – Congressman Rulli Co-Sponsors (12): Reps.

We in Congress are encouraged by President Trump’s vision of a stronger relationship between Greenland and the United States by offering to put forth a proposal to acquire Greenland and are eager to pave the way by providing official congressional authorization to do so. I’d like to thank Congressman Ogles for leading this initiative and look forward to supporting President Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland,” said Congressman Dunn. “Securing Greenland is critical to advancing America’s national security and economic interests. Four years of failed leadership under Joe Biden weakened our position on the global stage, but President Trump is once again putting America First. This legislation ensures we take bold steps to protect our future and send a clear message that the United States will lead with strength and strategy. I’m proud to support President Trump’s efforts by co-sponsoring the Make Greenland Great Again Act,” said Congressman Moore. “Does anyone regret the Louisiana Purchase or the acquisition of Alaska? The acquisition of Greenland represents a bold and essential expansion of American interests, one that would restore national pride and optimism to a country demoralized by the disastrous policies of the past four years under the Biden Administration. President Trump’s vision for Greenland is exactly what is needed to reignite the spirit of Manifest Destiny that once propelled Americans to greatness. A historic presidency deserves a historic beginning. Let’s Make Greenland Great Again!” – Congressman Rulli Co-Sponsors (12): Reps.

Washington Examiner Exclusive: Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) introduced the “Free Market Drives Itself Act” last week to eliminate the Electric Vehicles Working Group, which makes EV (link is external) recommendations to President Joe Biden’s (link is external) administration, in an effort to reduce EV spending.
“Electric vehicles are not a practical choice for Americans, and the Biden Administration’s attempts to force ‘ green (link is external) transportation’ on them is appalling and wasteful,” Ogles told the Washington Examiner .
“ There is approximately $7.5 billion in hard-earned taxpayer dollars being spent to build more charging stations,” Ogles added. “ Remember, just 7% of Americans own an electric vehicle, and the vast majority of those owners are far wealthier than most Americans. When your average family is paying $1,200 more per month for their basic cost of living, it is unconscionable that Biden would spend more money to hire additional federal bureaucrats to build costly charging stations that only benefit a tiny fraction of the population.”
Ogles’s argument that EVs are owned by the wealthy has support. Electric vehicles cost about $10,000 more than gas-powered vehicles on average (link is external) . Reps. Scott Perry (R-PA), Bob Good (R-VA), Cory Mills (R-FL), Matt Rosendale (R-MT), Randy Weber (R-TX), and Ralph Norman (R-SC) are co-sponsoring the bill.
“The Democratic Party loves to pretend that it is the ‘party of the people,’ but it is truly the party of the out-of-touch wealthy elites,” Ogles added. “The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation’s Electric Vehicle Working Group (EVWG) has got to go. We need to let the free market drive itself because Joe Biden’s policies are driving hardworking Americans straight off an economic cliff.”
The bill is another attempt from Republicans to cut government spending and highlight the Biden administration’s ineffective rollout (link is external) of electric vehicle charging stations. A March report (link is external) indicated there were only seven open charging stations out of 500,000 promised by 2030.
The bill has been referred to three House committees: Energy and Commerce, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Science, Space, and Technology.

WASHINGTON DC - Congressman Andy Ogles (TN-05) introduced the “Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored Threats Act.”  This bill would establish an interagency task force, led by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to address the widespread cybersecurity threats posed by state-sponsored cyber actors associated with the CCP.
The legislation also requires the task force to provide a detailed report and briefing to Congress annually for five years on its findings. The legislation was advanced by the House Committee on Homeland Security and passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in the 118th Congress.
“The Chinese Communist Party is the greatest foreign adversary we face, and Beijing continues to use cyberspace as a battlefield on which to undermine American sovereignty and interests. In the wake of attacks by CCP-backed actors against our critical infrastructure and even their intrusions into the campaign communications of President Trump and Vice President Vance, we must ensure the government is coordinating effectively to make sure this never happens again,” Congressman Ogles said . “As we learned from the Biden-Harris administration, turning a blind eye to China’s intrusions only invites more attacks. I look forward to getting this legislation to President Trump’s desk so we can keep securing our nation from this deadly enemy.”
“For too long, the federal government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to combating increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks on our networks by Chinese-backed actors. Americans depend on critical infrastructure for vital services every day, from the phones in our pockets to the water in our homes and gas in our cars,” Chairman Mark Green said . “I fear the recent ‘Typhoon’ intrusions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the CCP’s espionage and pre-positioning in our infrastructure. With new threats mounting every day, our response must be a coordinated, whole-of-government effort. I am proud to continue fighting for this legislation alongside my friend and fellow Tennessean, Rep. Ogles. Let’s get this to the Senate and to President Trump’s desk without delay.”
“The cyber campaigns waged by PRC-backed actors like the Typhoons are acts of espionage aimed at placing U.S. critical infrastructure at risk. This legislation directs a focused, interagency response to identify, assess, and disrupt these persistent threats,” Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Chairman Andrew Garbarino said. “As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, I’m committed to ensuring the federal government uses every available tool to mitigate these threats and strengthen our cyber resilience where it matters most.”
"The Chinese Communist Party is increasingly using cyberattacks to target our critical infrastructure, and it's time to take action to address this growing threat to the American people,” Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party Chairman John Moolenaar said. “The Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored Threats Act will ensure the federal government has the resources and authority to defend against these threats and hold the CCP accountable. With groups like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon already compromising our systems, it's critical that we strengthen our defenses to protect national security and our economy.”
“The Chinese Communist Party, through cyber threat actors like Volt Typhoon, continues to infiltrate America’s critical infrastructure, posing a direct threat to our national security and economy. We cannot allow foreign adversaries to gain the upper hand through a fragmented response,” Rep. Laurel Lee said. “That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored Threats Act to ensure a unified, whole-of-government strategy to combat the CCP’s cyber aggression and protect the essential systems Americans rely on every day.”

WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Andy Ogles introduced the Make Education Great Again Act, codifying President Trump’s executive order closing the Department of Education entitled Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities. In line with the President’s Executive Order, the bill specifically allows the Education Secretary to dramatically cut funds allocated toward the Department and enhance transparency regarding educational content, policies, and funding. This bill will ensure that Congress permits President Trump’s directive to close the Department and that any cuts made by the Secretary are authorized. Nothing in this legislation shall be construed to regulate, restrict, or otherwise affect homeschooling.
“For far too long, the Department of Education has been poisoning the minds of students by injecting woke, anti-American curriculum into our schools. This Department not only oversaw record drops in student literacy and educational excellence, but it waged war against a traditional liberal education rooted in the texts of the Western tradition, classical trivium, and our Biblical heritage, said Congressman Ogles . “ Federalizing education reduced the community classroom to a Marxist breeding ground that influenced students to stray from the principles of their parents, rebel against society, and embrace postmodern nonsense. I am proud to join President Trump in his historic effort to save the American classroom and return character-led excellence to our schools.”

OGLES INTRODUCES BILL TO CODIFY TRUMP DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CLOSURE
Image March 26, 2025 Press Release WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Andy Ogles introduced the Make Education Great Again Act, codifying President Trump’s executive order closing the Department of Education entitled Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities. In line with the President’s Executive Order, the bill specifically allows the Education Secretary to dramatically cut funds allocated toward the Department and enhance transparency regarding educational content, policies, and funding. This bill will ensure that Congress permits President Trump’s directive to close the Department and that any cuts made by the Secretary are authorized. Nothing in this legislation shall be construed to regulate, restrict, or otherwise affect homeschooling. “For far too long, the Department of Education has been poisoning the minds of students by injecting woke, anti-American curriculum into our schools. This Department not only oversaw record drops in student literacy and educational excellence, but it waged war against a traditional liberal education rooted in the texts of the Western tradition, classical trivium, and our Biblical heritage, said Congressman Ogles . “ Federalizing education reduced the community classroom to a Marxist breeding ground that influenced students to stray from the principles of their parents, rebel against society, and embrace postmodern nonsense. I am proud to join President Trump in his historic effort to save the American classroom and return character-led excellence to our schools.” READ BILL HERE ###
