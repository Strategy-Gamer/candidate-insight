Senator Blackburn understands that Tennessee’s rural communities are the heart of the state’s agriculture businesses. As such, we should not have laws in place that hinder economic development in these areas, which is why she introduced the Paving the Way for Rural Communities Act of 2019 to remove outdated, burdensome regulatory hurdles from rural areas and provide much needed relief to those who do not have the means to pay for unnecessary compliance costs.
Marsha Blackburn: Farmers Are Pillars In Our Communities
Communist China is working hard to infiltrate every major U.S. sector, and the agricultural industry is no exception. Over the past few years, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in foreign investment in the agricultural sector from Communist China. A 2021 report by the Department of Agriculture confirms the CCP owns hundreds of thousands of acres of American agricultural land, representing a 30% jump in ownership from 2019 to 2020. To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act to bolster America’s agricultural industry and help protect against improper foreign investment.

Senator Blackburn knows that farmers are the backbone of the Volunteer State. Recently, many small Tennessee dairies have struggled to remain open as the state has lost about 300 dairy farms in about the last five years. To allow these businesses to diversify and expand their market competitiveness, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2023 . This legislation would help more American dairy farmers and processors add value to their businesses, including creating new products, expanding their markets, and modernizing their production facilities.

From tomatoes in the east to cotton in the west, Tennessee has a rich and diverse agricultural industry that is vital to the Volunteer State’s economy. Senator Blackburn has worked to protect our farmers from harmful regulations that impact their land use and water rights as well as their bottom line. Farmers are the best stewards of their land and should be the ones to determine how they farm it — not bureaucrats in Washington.

In early 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tried to force farmers to finance President Biden’s broken asylum program. Senator Blackburn pushed back and led a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting that the Department withdraw the proposed rule, calling on the administration to support our nation’s agriculture industry.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) introduced S. 2430, the Paving the Way for Rural Communities Act of 2019 to remove outdated, burdensome regulatory hurdles from rural areas. This will increase rural communities’ access to better economic opportunities and infrastructure projects.
“Tennessee’s rural communities are the heart of our state’s agriculture businesses. We should not have laws in place that hinder, rather than help, economic development in these areas,” said Senator Blackburn. “The Paving the Way for Rural Communities Act provides much needed relief to those who do not have the means to pay for unnecessary and burdensome compliance costs. This bill will help to lift up Tennesseans in rural communities and encourage economic growth.” “Georgia’s rural communities should have access to the same economic opportunities as our metropolitan areas when seeking federal assistance. Too often, federal mandates on local government prevent small and rural communities from applying for federal grant opportunities,” said Senator Perdue. “By removing these burdensome regulations, rural areas will have more flexibility to implement efficient infrastructure projects, while receiving greater federal investment. This bill will continue President Trump’s work to cut through bureaucratic red tape and unleash economic potential in Georgia and across the country.”
“We need new approaches to ensure rural towns and communities can compete for federal infrastructure resources. The permitting and review processes now in place are an incredible burden for rural Mississippi, where hiring expensive consultants and lawyer is out of the question,” Senator Hyde-Smith said. “The Paving the Way for Rural Communities Act would eliminate the pitfalls that keep rural communities from upgrading the infrastructure they need to grow and prosper.” This bill removes Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act requirements from federally funded projects or activities in any area that’s not part of a metropolitan statistical area as designated by the Office of Management and Budget.

NASHVILLE, TENN. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) introduced the Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2023, bipartisan legislation that will reauthorize and strengthen the Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives to help more American dairy farmers and processors add value to their businesses, including creating new products, expanding their markets, and modernizing their production facilities.
“The dairy industry is an essential part of the American economy. It is crucial that we provide the resources that dairies in Tennessee need to expand and create new products,” said Senator Blackburn. “With many small Tennessee dairies struggling to remain open, this bill will allow these businesses to diversify and expand their market competitiveness.”
“Wisconsin Dairy is essential to our Made in Wisconsin economy and our state’s identity. I’ve heard directly from dozens of Wisconsin dairies that have expanded their businesses thanks to the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives, and I’m proud to lead the charge to ensure this program has the resources it needs to help more businesses innovate and grow for the future,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our dairy farmers and producers face unique challenges, and expanding this program will give more small- and medium-sized dairy businesses the tools and opportunity to reach new markets, implement efficiencies, and create world-class products.”
“As one of only four Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives in the country, Tennessee’s grants to dairy businesses go a long way to help producers diversify products and markets, as well as increase the use of locally-produced milk,” said Charlie Hatcher, D.V.M., Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. “The initiative puts more money in dairy farmers’ pockets to create more jobs and strengthen local economies. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture supports the reauthorization of the Dairy Business Innovation Act and the recommended increase in funding through SDBII that will allow for success for dairy processors and producers.”
“Since its passage, the Dairy Business Innovation Act has been a major catalyst in increasing revenue for rural dairy businesses and in overcoming impediments to their expansion. As the program manager for the Southeast region, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) strongly supports the continuation and expansion of this valuable assistance to producers and the dairy industry. These grants, totaling more than $38.7 million in five years with more than $19.3 million focused on grants for dairy businesses, have had an historic impact on our industry in Tennessee and in the surrounding states, and we are grateful to Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for their support,” said Dr. Elizabeth Eckelkamp, Southeast Dairy Business Innovation Initiative program director and dairy Extension specialist with UTIA .
The Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2023:
Supports funding for the DBI Initiatives, authorizing $36 million per year, up from $20 million, to help more American farmers and processors modernize, reach new markets, and create economic growth.

“Since its passage, the Dairy Business Innovation Act has been a major catalyst in increasing revenue for rural dairy businesses and in overcoming impediments to their expansion. As the program manager for the Southeast region, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) strongly supports the continuation and expansion of this valuable assistance to producers and the dairy industry. These grants, totaling more than $38.7 million in five years with more than $19.3 million focused on grants for dairy businesses, have had an historic impact on our industry in Tennessee and in the surrounding states, and we are grateful to Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for their support,” said Dr. Elizabeth Eckelkamp, Southeast Dairy Business Innovation Initiative program director and dairy Extension specialist with UTIA .
The Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2023:
Supports funding for the DBI Initiatives, authorizing $36 million per year, up from $20 million, to help more American farmers and processors modernize, reach new markets, and create economic growth.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) introduced the Dairy Business Innovation Act to strengthen the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives (DBII) to help more American dairy farmers and processors add value to their businesses, including creating new products, expanding their markets, and modernizing their production facilities:
“The dairy industry is an essential part of the American economy. It is crucial that we provide the resources that dairies in Tennessee need to expand and create new products,” said Senator Blackburn . “With many small Tennessee dairies struggling to remain open, this bill will allow these businesses to diversify and expand their market competitiveness.”
“My Dairy Business Innovation Initiative has helped Wisconsin dairy farmers, producers, and cheesemakers grow their operations, tap into new markets, and innovate new products,” said Senator Baldwin. “From expanding facilities and growing their operations to improving packaging and lowering their shipping costs, this program has helped Wisconsin businesses grow their bottom lines and create jobs in our rural communities. I’m fighting to expand this vital program so more farmers, cheesemakers, and dairy processors have the tools to innovate and drive our rural economy forward.”
DAIRY BUSINESS INNOVATION ACT:
ENDORSEMENTS:
The legislation is endorsed by the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation , University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture , National Milk Producers Federation , Organic Valley , and International Dairy Foods Association .
“Tennessee’s dairy farmers are an integral part of our rural economy and provide wholesome, nutritious milk products to consumers. We thank Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for filing the Dairy Business Innovation Initiative which will be a successful opportunity for dairy farmers to add value to their milk and increase on-farm profitability. Further investments into DBII can create increased opportunities for consumers to access local dairy products and support their regional agricultural economy.” – Eric Mayberry, President of the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation
“We are grateful to Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for their support of the Dairy Business Innovation Act. It has had a historic impact on our Tennessee dairy industry and the development of the new Center for Dairy Advancement and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee. These resources will continue to help UTIA provide Real.Life.Solutions. to producers and processors across the region. Additionally, it has provided us with new partnership opportunities around the country.” – Dr. Keith Carver, Senior Vice Chancellor and Senior Vice President of the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture
“The Dairy Business Innovation Act continues to be a critical tool for dairy farms and processors across the Southeast region to overcome a history of low income, limited reinvestment into existing businesses, and high barriers to entry for new dairy businesses. As the program manager for the Southeast region, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) strongly supports the continuation and expansion of this valuable assistance to producers, processors, and the allied industries impacted by them. Since 2021, over $17 million has been directly invested into 189 dairy businesses across the 12 states and 1 territory in our region. Within Tennessee, 40 awards totaling almost $3.4 million have supported existing dairy farmers, processors, and emerging value-added dairy ventures. The funding for administration and research around the dairy industry has resulted in 5 new dairy Extension positions across Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina and has increased our understanding of consumer motivations around dairy. The new Center for Dairy Advancement and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee is a direct outcome of these grants, providing a unique hub of food, animal, economic, and consumer interaction to support the dairy industry.” – Dr. Elizabeth Eckelkamp, Southeast Dairy Business Innovation Initiative Program Director and Dairy Extension Specialist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture
“We thank Senators Baldwin and Blackburn for their continued bipartisan leadership in strengthening the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives program. Dairy has a storied history of pioneering effective new products and practices as dairy farmers and their cooperatives work to supply the U.S. and the world with nutritious, sustainably produced food. This program helps support researchers and their industry partners working to drive this innovation forward.” – Gregg Doud, President and CEO of National Milk Producers Federation
“Senator Tammy Baldwin and Senator Marsha Blackburn should be commended for a bill that enhances the assets and investments in the U.S. the dairy industry. Dairy is an economic engine in rural communities – we at Organic Valley know dairy processors who are doing more with support from this initiative and American farmers who are better positioned to bring milk to market because of it.” – Adam Warthesen, Vice President of Government and Industry Affairs at Organic Valley
“IDFA applauds Senators Baldwin and Blackburn for introducing the Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2025.  The bill promotes innovation in the dairy processing sector and will help industry members work together to address common challenges and create new market opportunities for healthy and nutritious dairy products.” – Michael Dykes, D.V.M., President & CEO of International Dairy Foods Association

I’m fighting to expand this vital program so more farmers, cheesemakers, and dairy processors have the tools to innovate and drive our rural economy forward.” DAIRY BUSINESS INNOVATION ACT: The DBII program was created in the 2018 Farm Bill, establishing multiple dairy business and innovation centers to serve producers across the country. These centers, in partnership with dairy farmers and processors, are spurring innovation in dairy businesses, fostering the development of new dairy products and modernizing existing dairy plants. As a result, the program has gone on to add value to the milk produced by American farmers and expand their market access. Each regional initiative is tasked with providing technical assistance and grants to farmers and processors, including: Supporting new and expanding dairy businesses— Centers provide assistance with business plan development, accounting, market evaluation, and strategic planning. Promoting innovation in dairy products— Dairy businesses receive assistance with product innovation, marketing and branding, packaging, distribution, supply chain innovation, food safety training and consultation, and dairy product production training. Assisting with dairy plant modernization and process improvement— Dairy businesses receive assistance with processing facility improvement, including assistance with plant upgrades, food safety modernization, energy and water efficiency, byproduct reprocessing and use maximization, and waste treatment.

“The Dairy Business Innovation Act continues to be a critical tool for dairy farms and processors across the Southeast region to overcome a history of low income, limited reinvestment into existing businesses, and high barriers to entry for new dairy businesses. As the program manager for the Southeast region, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) strongly supports the continuation and expansion of this valuable assistance to producers, processors, and the allied industries impacted by them. Since 2021, over $17 million has been directly invested into 189 dairy businesses across the 12 states and 1 territory in our region. Within Tennessee, 40 awards totaling almost $3.4 million have supported existing dairy farmers, processors, and emerging value-added dairy ventures. The funding for administration and research around the dairy industry has resulted in 5 new dairy Extension positions across Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina and has increased our understanding of consumer motivations around dairy. The new Center for Dairy Advancement and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee is a direct outcome of these grants, providing a unique hub of food, animal, economic, and consumer interaction to support the dairy industry.” – Dr. Elizabeth Eckelkamp, Southeast Dairy Business Innovation Initiative Program Director and Dairy Extension Specialist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture
“We thank Senators Baldwin and Blackburn for their continued bipartisan leadership in strengthening the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives program. Dairy has a storied history of pioneering effective new products and practices as dairy farmers and their cooperatives work to supply the U.S. and the world with nutritious, sustainably produced food. This program helps support researchers and their industry partners working to drive this innovation forward.” – Gregg Doud, President and CEO of National Milk Producers Federation
“Senator Tammy Baldwin and Senator Marsha Blackburn should be commended for a bill that enhances the assets and investments in the U.S. the dairy industry. Dairy is an economic engine in rural communities – we at Organic Valley know dairy processors who are doing more with support from this initiative and American farmers who are better positioned to bring milk to market because of it.” – Adam Warthesen, Vice President of Government and Industry Affairs at Organic Valley
“IDFA applauds Senators Baldwin and Blackburn for introducing the Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2025.  The bill promotes innovation in the dairy processing sector and will help industry members work together to address common challenges and create new market opportunities for healthy and nutritious dairy products.” – Michael Dykes, D.V.M., President & CEO of International Dairy Foods Association

Blackburn, Baldwin Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Support Tennessee Small Dairy Businesses
February 10, 2025
Blackburn, Baldwin Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Support Tennessee Small Dairy Businesses February 10, 2025 WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) introduced the Dairy Business Innovation Act to strengthen the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives (DBII) to help more American dairy farmers and processors add value to their businesses, including creating new products, expanding their markets, and modernizing their production facilities: “The dairy industry is an essential part of the American economy. It is crucial that we provide the resources that dairies in Tennessee need to expand and create new products,” said Senator Blackburn . “With many small Tennessee dairies struggling to remain open, this bill will allow these businesses to diversify and expand their market competitiveness.” “My Dairy Business Innovation Initiative has helped Wisconsin dairy farmers, producers, and cheesemakers grow their operations, tap into new markets, and innovate new products,” said Senator Baldwin. “From expanding facilities and growing their operations to improving packaging and lowering their shipping costs, this program has helped Wisconsin businesses grow their bottom lines and create jobs in our rural communities. I’m fighting to expand this vital program so more farmers, cheesemakers, and dairy processors have the tools to innovate and drive our rural economy forward.” DAIRY BUSINESS INNOVATION ACT: The DBII program was created in the 2018 Farm Bill, establishing multiple dairy business and innovation centers to serve producers across the country. These centers, in partnership with dairy farmers and processors, are spurring innovation in dairy businesses, fostering the development of new dairy products and modernizing existing dairy plants. As a result, the program has gone on to add value to the milk produced by American farmers and expand their market access. Each regional initiative is tasked with providing technical assistance and grants to farmers and processors, including: Supporting new and expanding dairy businesses— Centers provide assistance with business plan development, accounting, market evaluation, and strategic planning. Promoting innovation in dairy products— Dairy businesses receive assistance with product innovation, marketing and branding, packaging, distribution, supply chain innovation, food safety training and consultation, and dairy product production training. Assisting with dairy plant modernization and process improvement— Dairy businesses receive assistance with processing facility improvement, including assistance with plant upgrades, food safety modernization, energy and water efficiency, byproduct reprocessing and use maximization, and waste treatment. The Dairy Business Innovation Act builds on the support for regional dairy research and innovation centers across the country by raising the program’s annual authorization from $20 million to $36 million. ENDORSEMENTS: The legislation is endorsed by the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation , University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture , National Milk Producers Federation , Organic Valley , and International Dairy Foods Association . “Tennessee’s dairy farmers are an integral part of our rural economy and provide wholesome, nutritious milk products to consumers. We thank Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for filing the Dairy Business Innovation Initiative which will be a successful opportunity for dairy farmers to add value to their milk and increase on-farm profitability. Further investments into DBII can create increased opportunities for consumers to access local dairy products and support their regional agricultural economy.” – Eric Mayberry, President of the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation “We are grateful to Senators Blackburn and Baldwin for their support of the Dairy Business Innovation Act. It has had a historic impact on our Tennessee dairy industry and the development of the new Center for Dairy Advancement and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee. These resources will continue to help UTIA provide Real.Life.Solutions. to producers and processors across the region.

NASHVILLE, TENN. – Yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Revising Existing Procedures on Reporting via Technology (REPORT) Act, authored by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.).
“In today’s technological age, children have become increasingly vulnerable to online sexual exploitation,” said Senator Blackburn. “There is an urgent need to address loopholes in reporting these crimes and to equip the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement with the resources they need to adequately respond. I thank Senator Ossoff for his bipartisan partnership in this effort, and I look forward to the REPORT Act’s swift passage out of the House and to the President’s desk.”
“Our bipartisan bill will ensure tech companies are held accountable to report and remove child sex abuse material and to strengthen protection for kids online," said Senator Ossoff. "At a time of such division in Congress, we brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass this urgent legislation to protect kids on the internet.”

In July, Representatives Laurel Lee (R-Fla.), Susie Lee (D-Nev.), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), and Madeleine Dean (D-Penn.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. ENDORSEMENTS: The REPORT Act is endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), International Justice Mission (IJM), ECPAT-USA , the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), Fraternal Order of Police , ChildFund International , the End Online Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (OSEAC) Coalition , Wired Human , and Raven . “The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) applauds the hard work by Senator Blackburn, Senator Ossoff, and all the Senate co-sponsors to pass the REPORT Act,” said Michelle DeLaune, NCMEC President & CEO. “Last year NCMEC’s CyberTipline received over 32 million reports containing more than 88 million images/videos and other content concerning child sexual exploitation, and the volume of online child sexual exploitation continues to exponentially rise. We look forward to continuing our work with Senator Blackburn and Senator Ossoff to ensure the safety of children online, and we encourage House Leadership to join the fight and bring the REPORT Act to the floor for a vote.” BACKGROUND: The REPORT Act builds upon Senator Blackburn’s END Child Exploitation Act, which unanimously passed the Senate in 2022. Last updated in 2018, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s (NCMEC) CyberTipline is the nation’s centralized reporting system for the online exploitation of children. Using this system, electronic communication service providers can make reports of activities such as child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), child sex trafficking, enticement of children for sexual acts, and unsolicited obscene materials sent to a child. Currently, criminal law requires electronic communication service providers to report, as soon as reasonably possible, any CSAM they know is on their sites. The law allows for voluntary reporting of imminent crimes involving child sexual abuse material (i.e., enticement or grooming). NCMEC makes all reports filed available to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. A knowing and willful failure to report results in fines: $150,000 for the first incident and $300,000 for any second or subsequent violation. THE REPORT ACT: Converts the reporting requirements from permissive to mandatory; Adds sex trafficking of children and enticement crimes to the reporting obligations within 180 days of the bill’s enactment; Increases penalties for failure to report exploitative content ($600K-$850K on the first offense; $850K-$1M on the second offense); Increases the time that evidence submitted to the CyberTipline is preserved, allowing law enforcement more time to investigate and prosecute (from 90 days to 1 year). Allows for tipline reporting to NCMEC by people depicted in CSAM as minors and their representatives; Allows for the cloud storage and transfer of tipline reports from NCMEC to law enforcement; and Implements security measures to ensure the safe handling and storage of CyberTipline reports.

NASHVILLE, TENN. – The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act authored by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.). The bipartisan legislation will strengthen federal efforts to expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips.
“The passage of this legislation in the U.S. Senate is a win for Tennessee manufacturers who rely on semiconductors to support local and global supply chains,” said Senator Blackburn . “As long as the U.S. continues to depend on Communist China for semiconductor production, our supply chain, economy and national security are all at risk. We need to encourage economic development with local leaders in order to identify resource gaps and address challenges faced by businesses in meeting their bottom line.”
“In order to remain a global economic powerhouse in the 21st century, we must continue to build on the investments we made in the CHIPS and Science Act to boost U.S. production of semiconductor chips, which we know will dictate the future of technology and innovation,” said Senator Peters. “My bipartisan bill would do just that by strengthening our efforts to attract investment in American semiconductor manufacturers as well as their suppliers, reducing our dependence on foreign producers for these critical technologies and creating good-paying jobs here at home.”

The SelectUSA program was established in 2011 to improve federal efforts that attract job-creating business investments in the United States and that support U.S. firms. The senators put forward this bipartisan bill after the Biden Administration issued a report emphasizing that the SelectUSA program could be further leveraged to strengthen private sector investments across the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain, in particular . The Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act would direct the SelectUSA program to engage with state-level economic development organizations about how they are attracting foreign direct investment to onshore activities related to semiconductor manufacturing, and identify what resource gaps or other challenges they face in achieving that goal. SelectUSA would then be required to develop strategies to increase investments in semiconductor manufacturing. ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS: Joining Senators Blackburn and Peters in reintroducing the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act were Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.).

U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) led 7 of her colleagues in a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting that the Department withdraw a proposal that would raise fees for farmers and small businesses who sponsor foreign national workers. The proposal would also add a $600 fee to pay for President Biden’s broken asylum program. Blackburn was joined by Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). DHS Wants Small Business Owners And Farmers To Fund Biden’s Broken Asylum Program “Specifically, we are concerned about the impact that these proposed fee increases will have on the agriculture industry throughout the country. The proposed rule would increase the fees for H-2A petitions, which encompass seasonal agricultural workers, from $460 to $1,090 for named workers and from $460 to $530 for unnamed workers… More troubling, however, is the new AsylumProgram Fee. This proposed rule would charge employers seeking to sponsor immigrants for certain work visas an unprecedented $600 fee to fund our broken asylum program. To justify this proposal, DHS contends that this cost shifting approach with the Asylum Program Fee will “place greater emphasis on the ability-to-pay principle for determining user fees.” In other words, DHS believes small business owners should be forced to finance President Biden’s overwhelmed and broken asylum program that is entirely unrelated to the issuance of immigrant work visas,” wrote the Senators. Biden’s Asylum Fee Proposal Will Hurt Small Businesses and Farmers “We are deeply disappointed that the Biden Administration continues to reward illegal entry into this country, especially at the expense of hardworking entrepreneurs and farmers who are operating within the legal parameters of the immigration system. It is time for President Biden to take the crisis at our southern border seriously and support our small businesses and farmers. For all of these reasons, we urge you to withdraw this deeply flawed proposed rule,” concluded the Senators. Read the full letter to Secretary Mayorkas here .

This proposed rule would charge employers seeking to sponsor immigrants for certain work visas an unprecedented $600 fee to fund our broken asylum program. To justify this proposal, DHS contends that this cost shifting approach with the Asylum Program Fee will “place greater emphasis on the ability-to-pay principle for determining user fees.” In other words, DHS believes small business owners should be forced to finance President Biden’s overwhelmed and broken asylum program that is entirely unrelated to the issuance of immigrant work visas,” wrote the Senators. Biden’s Asylum Fee Proposal Will Hurt Small Businesses and Farmers “We are deeply disappointed that the Biden Administration continues to reward illegal entry into this country, especially at the expense of hardworking entrepreneurs and farmers who are operating within the legal parameters of the immigration system. It is time for President Biden to take the crisis at our southern border seriously and support our small businesses and farmers.

U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) introduced bipartisan legislation to protect America’s agricultural industry from improper foreign investment. Over the past few years, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in foreign investment in the agricultural sector, particularly from China. We must increase oversight and transparency to secure our country’s food supply. The Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act will bolster the U.S. agricultural industry’s role on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the governmental body that oversees the vetting process of foreign investment and acquisition of American companies. “Communist China is working hard to infiltrate every major U.S. sector, and the agricultural industry is no exception. We’ve already seen Beijing threaten to withhold critical lifesaving medications from the U.S. during the peak of COVID, and we cannot allow them to have that same grip on our food supply chain. This legislation takes a significant step to bolster America’s agricultural industry and help protect against improper foreign investment,” said Senator Blackburn. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen an alarming increase in foreign purchases of farm land and food companies, particularly by China,” said Senator Tuberville. “These foreign investments are now reaching every piece of the very large puzzle that makes up our agriculture industry, from farming and processing, to packaging and shipping. That’s why America’s agriculture community needs to have a permanent seat at the table when our government vets foreign investment in our country. Adding all parts of the agricultural supply chain to the list of transactions reviewed by CFIUS is the first step toward ensuring America’s agricultural suppliers can keep food on tables across the country.” In the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressmen Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), Pete Sessions (R-Texas), and Abigail Spanberger (D-Virginia) introduced similar legislation. “Today, America faces numerous threats to its national security, and the agricultural industry is no exception,” said Representative Jackson . “Our adversaries, especially the Chinese Communist Party, continue to increase their presence in America’s food industry and agricultural supply chains. Our national security is dependent on our food security, and we must take significant steps to identify adversaries that are manipulating critical facets of food production in our country. America’s agricultural industry must be considered when determining national security threats from foreign investments moving forward. The protection of our food supply and its overarching supply chains are essential for the continued prosperity of our nation. Together, we will ensure that America’s agricultural industry remains strong and independent from foreign adverse influence.” “Foreign investment in the American agriculture industry continues to grow at a rapid pace,” said Representative Sessions . “A large percentage of this land is owned by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backed investments, which poses a large national security risk, as it affords China the opportunity to undermine our food and investment industries. The United States farmland is a critical piece of infrastructure and should continue to be recognized as such. Our food insecurity is a matter of national security. The FARM Act will give us the opportunity to better combat maligned foreign investments in agriculture and protect the American people. I am proud to stand next to my fellow members of Congress during this renewed effort to secure American interests.” “Direct foreign investment in American agriculture and infrastructure has skyrocketed — and the Chinese Communist Party has driven much of this growth,” said Representative Spanberger . “In the face of significant foreign investment in American farmland, we need to recognize how foreign actors could pose potential threats to our economic strength, the competitiveness of our ag industry, and our national security. By bringing the voice of the Secretary of Agriculture to the table, our FARM Act would bring the concerns of farm families and producers to important conversations about the risks of foreign acquisitions and landholdings. As a Member of the House Agriculture Committee and a Member of Congress focused on threats to our national security, I’m proud to help introduce this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.” “Now more than ever, it is important to protect American supply chains,” said Representative Gonzalez. “The FARM Act equips us to monitor foreign investment and protect the integrity of our food systems to ensure a food secure future for all Americans. I am proud to be joining my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to protect American agriculture and strengthen our food supply chain.” BACKGROUND The Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that would ensure the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) acknowledges the importance of our agricultural industry and agricultural supply chains for our nation's safe and secure food supply. CFIUS is authorized to oversee and review foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses as it relates to national security. Currently, the Committee does not directly consider the needs of the agricultural industry when reviewing foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses.

Blackburn, Tuberville Lead Effort to Protect Ag Industry from Foreign Interference
February 24, 2023
Blackburn, Tuberville Lead Effort to Protect Ag Industry from Foreign Interference February 24, 2023 U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) introduced bipartisan legislation to protect America’s agricultural industry from improper foreign investment. Over the past few years, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in foreign investment in the agricultural sector, particularly from China. We must increase oversight and transparency to secure our country’s food supply. The Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act will bolster the U.S. agricultural industry’s role on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the governmental body that oversees the vetting process of foreign investment and acquisition of American companies. “Communist China is working hard to infiltrate every major U.S. sector, and the agricultural industry is no exception. We’ve already seen Beijing threaten to withhold critical lifesaving medications from the U.S. during the peak of COVID, and we cannot allow them to have that same grip on our food supply chain. This legislation takes a significant step to bolster America’s agricultural industry and help protect against improper foreign investment,” said Senator Blackburn. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen an alarming increase in foreign purchases of farm land and food companies, particularly by China,” said Senator Tuberville. “These foreign investments are now reaching every piece of the very large puzzle that makes up our agriculture industry, from farming and processing, to packaging and shipping. That’s why America’s agriculture community needs to have a permanent seat at the table when our government vets foreign investment in our country. Adding all parts of the agricultural supply chain to the list of transactions reviewed by CFIUS is the first step toward ensuring America’s agricultural suppliers can keep food on tables across the country.” In the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressmen Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), Pete Sessions (R-Texas), and Abigail Spanberger (D-Virginia) introduced similar legislation. “Today, America faces numerous threats to its national security, and the agricultural industry is no exception,” said Representative Jackson . “Our adversaries, especially the Chinese Communist Party, continue to increase their presence in America’s food industry and agricultural supply chains. Our national security is dependent on our food security, and we must take significant steps to identify adversaries that are manipulating critical facets of food production in our country. America’s agricultural industry must be considered when determining national security threats from foreign investments moving forward. The protection of our food supply and its overarching supply chains are essential for the continued prosperity of our nation. Together, we will ensure that America’s agricultural industry remains strong and independent from foreign adverse influence.” “Foreign investment in the American agriculture industry continues to grow at a rapid pace,” said Representative Sessions . “A large percentage of this land is owned by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backed investments, which poses a large national security risk, as it affords China the opportunity to undermine our food and investment industries. The United States farmland is a critical piece of infrastructure and should continue to be recognized as such. Our food insecurity is a matter of national security. The FARM Act will give us the opportunity to better combat maligned foreign investments in agriculture and protect the American people. I am proud to stand next to my fellow members of Congress during this renewed effort to secure American interests.” “Direct foreign investment in American agriculture and infrastructure has skyrocketed — and the Chinese Communist Party has driven much of this growth,” said Representative Spanberger . “In the face of significant foreign investment in American farmland, we need to recognize how foreign actors could pose potential threats to our economic strength, the competitiveness of our ag industry, and our national security. By bringing the voice of the Secretary of Agriculture to the table, our FARM Act would bring the concerns of farm families and producers to important conversations about the risks of foreign acquisitions and landholdings. As a Member of the House Agriculture Committee and a Member of Congress focused on threats to our national security, I’m proud to help introduce this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.” “Now more than ever, it is important to protect American supply chains,” said Representative Gonzalez. “The FARM Act equips us to monitor foreign investment and protect the integrity of our food systems to ensure a food secure future for all Americans. I am proud to be joining my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to protect American agriculture and strengthen our food supply chain.” BACKGROUND The Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that would ensure the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) acknowledges the importance of our agricultural industry and agricultural supply chains for our nation's safe and secure food supply. CFIUS is authorized to oversee and review foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses as it relates to national security. Currently, the Committee does not directly consider the needs of the agricultural industry when reviewing foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses. Specifically, the Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act would: Add the Secretary of Agriculture as a member to CFIUS Add language to protect the U.S. agricultural industry from foreign control through transactions, mergers, acquisitions, or agreements designate agricultural supply chains as critical infrastructure and critical technologies Report to Congress on current and potential foreign investments in the U.S. agricultural industry from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) ### https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2023/2/issues/agriculture/blackburn-tuberville-lead-effort-to-protect-ag-industry-from-foreign-interference
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and John Thune (R-S.D.), along with Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) called out President Biden and his administration for forcing their radical environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies onto the American economy in pursuit of their unrealistic environmental agenda. The letter calls attention to various actions by financial regulators that threaten to choke off certain industries’ access to capital, which could raise the price of food and energy for businesses and families amid record-high inflation.
“All of these actions have real-world impacts that your administration would be well served to evaluate,” the Senators wrote . “For instance, establishing rules, strategic plans, and principles to coerce financial institutions and other firms to limit their lending and exposure to certain businesses drives up prices on consumers. Choking off access to capital for companies in the energy sector in an attempt to decimate the fossil fuels industry drives up the cost of fuel and electricity at a time of record costs, further stoking inflation. Discouraging lending to farming and ranching communities in an attempt to reduce natural livestock emissions strains supply chains and increases the cost of food. Therefore, it would be prudent for your administration to actually take the time to evaluate the costs its actions are directly and indirectly imposing on American businesses and families, as well as conduct the necessary analysis as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As our nation continues to grapple with record-high inflation, administrative actions that increase prices should be the last thing on your agenda.”

Dear President Biden:
As we turn to a new Congress in a few weeks, we write to draw your attention to our ongoing concerns with your administration’s unrealistic environmental agenda and focus on government-imposed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. While businesses may elect to pursue their own ESG agendas as part of a free-market society, the heavy-handed imposition from the federal government will have (and in some cases, already has had) negative real-world impacts on our economy and American families, especially by deepening the ongoing energy and inflation crises.
In the nearly two years since you were sworn into office, your administration has made countless efforts to push through its sweeping environmental agenda through the financial regulators. These efforts, though sold by administration officials as steps necessary to mitigate climate risks, are solely an attempt to strong-arm financial institutions and other firms into choking off capital to industries that are foundational to our nation’s economy, yet are continually villainized by the far left.
One example of your administration’s overreach is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) proposed climate-disclosure rule that would not only require registrants to disclose information about their greenhouse gas emissions, but, in many cases, indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities (i.e., their suppliers and customers) in their value chain – known as scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are not produced or even controlled by the regulated organization, making this rule entirely unworkable for any public company to comply with. The rule would also require registrants to comply with new financial impact metric disclosure requirements and determine the effects of certain climate-related events on each line item of their consolidated financial statements. The rule would almost certainly reduce or potentially even eliminate businesses’ access to the resources they need to operate, as it would discourage firms from investing in or extending capital to them. The SEC rule would be destructive for businesses in the energy and agriculture sectors, but to businesses, in particular small businesses, across all sectors of our economy as well.
Equally alarming is the recently proposed Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule that would similarly require certain federal contractors to publicly disclose not only their greenhouse gas emissions, but scope 3 emissions, compounding the burden imposed by the SEC. Ultimately, private companies would be disincentivized to apply for these federal contracts altogether, which would increase project costs for the federal government and harm taxpayers.
Unfortunately, your administration’s efforts to use financial regulators to force through an unrealistic environmental agenda do not end there. After joining the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, an organization with the stated agenda of “mobilizing mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy,” the Federal Reserve announced a pilot program to analyze the climate-related financial risks for the nation’s largest banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and, most recently, the Federal Reserve have all published draft principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. The Department of Labor just finalized a rule that would, in practice, require pension fiduciaries to consider climate change and ESG factors in making investment decisions, irrespective of their pecuniary relevance. And last, but certainly not least, the National Credit Union Administration published a since-rescinded strategic plan that seemed to recommend credit unions need to alter their field of membership and loan offerings in farming communities.
All of these actions have real-world impacts that your administration would be well served to evaluate. For instance, establishing rules, strategic plans, and principles to coerce financial institutions and other firms to limit their lending and exposure to certain businesses drives up prices on consumers. Choking off access to capital for companies in the energy sector in an attempt to decimate the fossil fuels industry drives up the cost of fuel and electricity at a time of record costs, further stoking inflation. Discouraging lending to farming and ranching communities in an attempt to reduce natural livestock emissions strains supply chains and increases the cost of food. Therefore, it would be prudent for your administration to actually take the time to evaluate the costs its actions are directly and indirectly imposing on American businesses and families, as well as conduct the necessary analysis as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As our nation continues to grapple with record-high inflation, administrative actions that increase prices should be the last thing on your agenda.
Of course, financial institutions and other firms need to be mindful of their exposure to and concentration in certain industries to ensure safety and soundness. However, your administration must recognize that, though these ESG-type regulatory actions are generally targeted at the nation’s largest financial institutions and Wall Street firms, they have a trickledown effect on our nation’s community banks and credit unions that are feeling the pressure from Washington. These entities, which are essential for economic opportunity and stability across the country, are concerned about how your administration’s myopic environmental agenda could impede their ability to lend to their clients and foster the growth necessary to steer our economy away from a recession. And in rural communities, community banks and credit unions are acutely wary of how your administration’s overreach could harm their ability to lend to their agriculture clients.
As you head into the second half of your current term, it is vitally important that your administration, prior to taking action and pumping out rules, actually look beyond the beltway and take into account the real-world impacts that financial regulators’ environmental actions have on businesses, families, and community banks and credit unions across the nation. This common sense is long overdue.
Sincerely,

“All of these actions have real-world impacts that your administration would be well served to evaluate,” the Senators wrote . “For instance, establishing rules, strategic plans, and principles to coerce financial institutions and other firms to limit their lending and exposure to certain businesses drives up prices on consumers. Choking off access to capital for companies in the energy sector in an attempt to decimate the fossil fuels industry drives up the cost of fuel and electricity at a time of record costs, further stoking inflation. Discouraging lending to farming and ranching communities in an attempt to reduce natural livestock emissions strains supply chains and increases the cost of food. Therefore, it would be prudent for your administration to actually take the time to evaluate the costs its actions are directly and indirectly imposing on American businesses and families, as well as conduct the necessary analysis as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As our nation continues to grapple with record-high inflation, administrative actions that increase prices should be the last thing on your agenda.”

Dear President Biden:
As we turn to a new Congress in a few weeks, we write to draw your attention to our ongoing concerns with your administration’s unrealistic environmental agenda and focus on government-imposed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. While businesses may elect to pursue their own ESG agendas as part of a free-market society, the heavy-handed imposition from the federal government will have (and in some cases, already has had) negative real-world impacts on our economy and American families, especially by deepening the ongoing energy and inflation crises.
In the nearly two years since you were sworn into office, your administration has made countless efforts to push through its sweeping environmental agenda through the financial regulators. These efforts, though sold by administration officials as steps necessary to mitigate climate risks, are solely an attempt to strong-arm financial institutions and other firms into choking off capital to industries that are foundational to our nation’s economy, yet are continually villainized by the far left.
One example of your administration’s overreach is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) proposed climate-disclosure rule that would not only require registrants to disclose information about their greenhouse gas emissions, but, in many cases, indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities (i.e., their suppliers and customers) in their value chain – known as scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are not produced or even controlled by the regulated organization, making this rule entirely unworkable for any public company to comply with. The rule would also require registrants to comply with new financial impact metric disclosure requirements and determine the effects of certain climate-related events on each line item of their consolidated financial statements. The rule would almost certainly reduce or potentially even eliminate businesses’ access to the resources they need to operate, as it would discourage firms from investing in or extending capital to them. The SEC rule would be destructive for businesses in the energy and agriculture sectors, but to businesses, in particular small businesses, across all sectors of our economy as well.
Equally alarming is the recently proposed Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule that would similarly require certain federal contractors to publicly disclose not only their greenhouse gas emissions, but scope 3 emissions, compounding the burden imposed by the SEC. Ultimately, private companies would be disincentivized to apply for these federal contracts altogether, which would increase project costs for the federal government and harm taxpayers.
Unfortunately, your administration’s efforts to use financial regulators to force through an unrealistic environmental agenda do not end there. After joining the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, an organization with the stated agenda of “mobilizing mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy,” the Federal Reserve announced a pilot program to analyze the climate-related financial risks for the nation’s largest banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and, most recently, the Federal Reserve have all published draft principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. The Department of Labor just finalized a rule that would, in practice, require pension fiduciaries to consider climate change and ESG factors in making investment decisions, irrespective of their pecuniary relevance. And last, but certainly not least, the National Credit Union Administration published a since-rescinded strategic plan that seemed to recommend credit unions need to alter their field of membership and loan offerings in farming communities.
All of these actions have real-world impacts that your administration would be well served to evaluate. For instance, establishing rules, strategic plans, and principles to coerce financial institutions and other firms to limit their lending and exposure to certain businesses drives up prices on consumers. Choking off access to capital for companies in the energy sector in an attempt to decimate the fossil fuels industry drives up the cost of fuel and electricity at a time of record costs, further stoking inflation. Discouraging lending to farming and ranching communities in an attempt to reduce natural livestock emissions strains supply chains and increases the cost of food. Therefore, it would be prudent for your administration to actually take the time to evaluate the costs its actions are directly and indirectly imposing on American businesses and families, as well as conduct the necessary analysis as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As our nation continues to grapple with record-high inflation, administrative actions that increase prices should be the last thing on your agenda.
Of course, financial institutions and other firms need to be mindful of their exposure to and concentration in certain industries to ensure safety and soundness. However, your administration must recognize that, though these ESG-type regulatory actions are generally targeted at the nation’s largest financial institutions and Wall Street firms, they have a trickledown effect on our nation’s community banks and credit unions that are feeling the pressure from Washington. These entities, which are essential for economic opportunity and stability across the country, are concerned about how your administration’s myopic environmental agenda could impede their ability to lend to their clients and foster the growth necessary to steer our economy away from a recession. And in rural communities, community banks and credit unions are acutely wary of how your administration’s overreach could harm their ability to lend to their agriculture clients.
As you head into the second half of your current term, it is vitally important that your administration, prior to taking action and pumping out rules, actually look beyond the beltway and take into account the real-world impacts that financial regulators’ environmental actions have on businesses, families, and community banks and credit unions across the nation. This common sense is long overdue.

NASHVILLE, TENN. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) along with U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced the Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022, which would end the harmful practice of soring in show horses while preventing inhibitory bureaucratic overregulation to preserve the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. The industry is vital for America’s agriculture economy, providing billions of dollars in economic impact across several states and employing over 20,000 people.
“The Volunteer State has a rich history with Tennessee Walking Horses,” said Senator Blackburn. "Bad actors are using caustic chemicals, pressure shoeing, and other harmful practices to undermine the prestige of the industry. The Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022 will stop these bad actors and ensure that this Volunteer State tradition continues for years to come.”
“The Tennessee Walking Horse industry is steeped in rich tradition dating back to 1886, and every year thousands of enthusiasts gather in Shelbyville, Tennessee, for the celebration of this great animal,” said Senator Hagerty. “I am pleased to introduce legislation that will support this important industry by bringing regulatory certainty that is objective and scientifically based while protecting horses, breeders, and competitors moving forward.”
Specifically, the Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022 would give state officials and industry and equine experts with extensive experience the authority to ensure consistent oversight of inspections related to horse soring. It would also require objective scientific testing, prevent conflicts of interest, and suspend horses from shows if they are found to be sore.

AGRICULTURE
From tomatoes in the east to cotton in the west, Tennessee has a rich and diverse agricultural industry that is vital to the Volunteer State’s economy. Senator Blackburn has worked to protect our farmers from harmful regulations that impact their land use and water rights as well as their bottom line. Farmers are the best stewards of their land and should be the ones to determine how they farm it — not bureaucrats in Washington.
What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Support Farmers
Senator Blackburn understands that Tennessee’s rural communities are the heart of the state’s agriculture businesses. As such, we should not have laws in place that hinder economic development in these areas, which is why she introduced the Paving the Way for Rural Communities Act of 2019 to remove outdated, burdensome regulatory hurdles from rural areas and provide much needed relief to those who do not have the means to pay for unnecessary compliance costs.


Marsha Blackburn: Farmers Are Pillars In Our Communities

Communist China is working hard to infiltrate every major U.S. sector, and the agricultural industry is no exception. Over the past few years, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in foreign investment in the agricultural sector from Communist China. A 2021 report by the Department of Agriculture confirms the CCP owns hundreds of thousands of acres of American agricultural land, representing a 30% jump in ownership from 2019 to 2020. To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act to bolster America’s agricultural industry and help protect against improper foreign investment. 

In early 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tried to force farmers to finance President Biden’s broken asylum program. Senator Blackburn pushed back and led a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting that the Department withdraw the proposed rule, calling on the administration to support our nation’s agriculture industry.

Blackburn Slams Biden And Democrats Over America's Crime Surge

Senator Blackburn knows that farmers are the backbone of the Volunteer State. Recently, many small Tennessee dairies have struggled to remain open as the state has lost about 300 dairy farms in about the last five years. To allow these businesses to diversify and expand their market competitiveness, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2023. This legislation would help more American dairy farmers and processors add value to their businesses, including creating new products, expanding their markets, and modernizing their production facilities.

Additionally, each year on her 95 County Tour, Senator Blackburn visits with local farmers and groups supporting agriculture.

BORDER SECURITY
The United States is a country governed by the rule of law. Yet, the Biden administration has sought to undermine the rule of law and make illegal immigration legal. On day one, President Biden quickly implemented his open border agenda, halted border wall construction, and issued an executive order that encouraged more illegal immigrants to enter our country. 

The Biden administration ended Title 42, terminated President Trump’s successful “Remain in Mexico” policy, brought back catch-and-release, and pushed amnesty for all. President Biden issued 94 executive orders within his first 100 days in office to implement his open border agenda. The result? An unprecedented border crisis with over 10.3 million illegals entering our country under Biden’s watch.

Senator Blackburn has strongly opposed amnesty for all and the spread of sanctuary cities and states that operate as lawless havens for illegal immigrants. Secure countries have secure borders. A wall puts a stop to the caravans of illegal immigrants trying to cross our border, and blocks the flow of drugs, human trafficking, terrorists, and other dangerous criminals. Until we secure our border and ports of entry, every state in our nation will be a border state, and every town will be a border town.

Senator Blackburn: Tennesseans Are Suffering Because Of Biden's Open Border Agenda

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Combat the Border Crisis
Senator Blackburn has long been a leader in the fight to end Biden’s border crisis, taking action on legislation related to drug smuggling, human trafficking, child exploitation, and more.

Since starting her first term in the United States Senate, Senator Blackburn has visited the southern border four times.

At the start of the 118th Congress, Senator Blackburn led a delegation of her colleagues to the Del Rio Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border to examine the disastrous effects of Biden’s border crisis firsthand.


Blackburn, Hyde-Smith, Britt Expose Harsh Reality of Biden's Border Crisis

After the Biden administration allowed Title 42 to expire, Senator Blackburn introduced the Make the Migrant Protection Protocols Mandatory Act which would reinstate the successful Trump-era policy that required illegal immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border or without proper documentation to return to Mexico to await their immigration proceedings. 

Senator Blackburn has also led legislation aimed at combating human trafficking along the southern border. Notably, in April 2023 after learning that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lost track of 85,000 unaccompanied migrant children, Senator Blackburn blasted HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and the Biden administration over this gross incompetence and sent a series of letters demanding transparency to protect these innocent children.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has introduced the End Child Trafficking Now Act which would require a DNA test to determine the relationship between illegal immigrants coming across the border and any accompanying children, as well as the PRINTS Act, which would prevent child recycling by giving U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) the authority to fingerprint non-citizens under the age of 14.

Senator Blackburn Visits The Southern Border Amid Heightened Crisis

In March 2024, Senator Blackburn visited the southern border amid the sovereignty battle between the Biden administration and the state of Texas over the enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. While meeting with Texas DPS, members of the Texas National Guard, and  National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd, she viewed how Texas is utilizing buoys, barbed wire, fencing and containers to secure the border. As Texas has secured their border, they have seen illegal crossings drop. Senator Blackburn’s CONTAINER Act would empower border states to place temporary barriers on federal land in order to protect their communities.

CHINA
The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) campaign for global dominance presents a clear threat to the world. Recent events have shined a bright light on Beijing's efforts to dismantle democracies worldwide, the CCP’s attempts to extend its harmful global influence, and the ongoing challenges in the United States' relationship with Beijing. 

Throughout her career in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, Senator Blackburn has consistently raised concerns about China’s outsized role in global affairs and has been a leader in the fight to hold the Chinese regime accountable. From demanding answers from Beijing for their countless human rights abuses to the dictatorship’s theft of intellectual property and spreading COVID-19, Senator Blackburn will not stop speaking out about the threats posed by the CCP.

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Stop Communist China
The COVID-19 Pandemic

We know that China, for at least two weeks and likely longer, hid the deadly COVID-19 virus from the international community, allowing it to spread across the globe. Not long after COVID-19 reached the United States and the rest of the world, the CCP launched its propaganda campaign blaming American interests for the spread of the novel coronavirus. At the same time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency in March 2020, Chinese officials and state media began peddling the lie that the virus may have been leaked from a U.S. Army lab. 

Senator Blackburn pushed back against this Chinese propaganda and in May 2020, she filed the Stop COVID Act, which would allow American victims of the pandemic to sue Chinese officials in U.S. court. Senator Blackburn also led a bipartisan, bicameral resolution calling on China to take responsibility for its abject failure to be forthright about the severity of the COVID-19 crisis it created.


Blackburn on China’s COVID Culpability

Furthermore, following reports in 2023 that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory, Senator Blackburn called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to sue the CCP for its role in covering up the origins of the pandemic, which took the lives of over a million Americans.

Blackburn: Communist China Needs To Come Forward About COVID Origins

Protecting Our National Security

Since President Biden’s first day in office, the CCP’s aggression towards the U.S. has escalated, and our national security has been greatly endangered. Under the Biden-Harris administration, Beijing has spied on the U.S. through a variety of means — from sending operatives to U.S. military sites to purchasing land near sensitive military locations and setting up Confucius Institutes on college campuses. 

In June 2023, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Stemming The Operation of Pernicious and Illicit (STOP Illicit) Drones Act to limit the presence of Chinese-produced drones in the United States and keep our nation safer. Senator Blackburn also fought to secure vital national security wins in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act. In 2024, her measure to prohibit the FAA from funding foreign drone companies or procuring drones from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba was signed into law.


Blackburn: Communist China Is Using AI To Grow The Surveillance State

Following reports indicating that the CCP has secretly operated police stations in cities across America to spy on individuals, Senator Blackburn sent a letter to the FBI and DOJ calling for an immediate inquiry. She also introduced the Countering Chinese Espionage Reporting Act to ensure that the DOJ is doing everything in its power to safeguard our national security and protect U.S. intellectual property — like academic research and technological innovation — from being stolen and used by our adversaries. 

Additionally, after a China-backed spy balloon traversed into U.S. airspace for a week, Senator Blackburn demanded answers from President Biden on this blatant act of espionage that enabled the CCP to potentially collect valuable national security information and spy on American military assets.

As Communist China works to infiltrate every major U.S. sector, the agricultural industry is no exception. Over the past few years, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in foreign investment in the agricultural sector from Communist China. To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act to protect American farmland and ensure our food supply is not weaponized by Beijing.


Marsha Blackburn On Chinese Spy Balloon: This Would Never Have Happened Under Trump

Under the Biden-Harris administration, we have seen a surge in Chinese nationals attempting to cross the southern border. Senator Blackburn led her Republican colleagues in introducing the No Asylum for CCP Spies Act to prohibit members of communist or totalitarian parties, including the CCP, from being granted asylum in the U.S.

Senator Blackburn also strongly supported banning TikTok in the United States or divesting the company from its Chinese communist owner.

Securing American Interests

As one of the world’s leading democratic superpowers, the United States cannot afford to fall behind Communist China in its quest for global domination. Senator Blackburn understands that in order to remain competitive on the world stage, we must bolster our domestic industries and equip them with the tools for success.

Senator Blackburn has led legislation aimed at strengthening U.S. advanced defense capabilities. She introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Investing in American Defense Technologies Act to establish a federal public-private partnership to invest in American defense-centric small businesses, help fuel cutting-edge defense technology production, and make the United States more competitive with adversaries like China.

Additionally, after deep vulnerabilities in our country's national supply chains caused by our dependence on Communist China were exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act to streamline federal efforts to boost domestic manufacturers and support workers.

Communist China has publicly acknowledged its goal to lead the world in quantum communications by 2049. It’s critical the United States provides an environment for entrepreneurs and companies to promote competition and continued innovation, which is why Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Quantum Sandbox for Near-Term Applications Act.

Furthermore, according to the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, the CCP has stolen enough intellectual property (IP) to cost the United States an estimated $225 billion to $600 billion every year. Amid these persistent attempts to steal intellectual property and invalidate U.S. patents, Senator Blackburn has led several measures to protect American innovators and creators from IP theft, including the No Free TRIPS Act to stop foreign companies from profiting off American medical advances.


Marsha Blackburn: Communist China Is Trying To Steal Our Intellectual Property

Senator Blackburn has long advocated for tougher action on trademark protections for music in the Chinese market. As Communist China seeks to violate copyright law in the United States, it is imperative that we fight for our creative community to ensure songwriters are properly compensated for their hard work.
Defending Freedom for Taiwan, the Uyghurs, and Hong Kong

Beijing is known for its use of political violence, speech suppression, and torture to silence dissent and concentrate power in the hands of the CCP. Senator Blackburn has never shied away from the fight as she continues to stand up for Taiwan, the Uyghur Muslims, and the Hong Kong Freedom Fighters against the Chinese regime’s brutality.

As Communist China continues to seek domination over Taiwan, Senator Blackburn has been a staunch defender of independence for the Indo-Pacific nation. In August 2022, Senator Blackburn visited Taiwan, met with President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, and called to strengthen connections between the U.S. and Taiwan. During this visit, Senator Blackburn made it clear: Taiwan is a country. Senator Blackburn firmly believes in ensuring Taiwan has the capacity to defend itself, which is why she introduced the Taiwan Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act.


Senator Blackburn Meets With Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-Wen in Taipei to Further Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Nations and Calls Taiwan a Country, 8.26.22

In early 2024, Senator Blackburn supported a bipartisan resolution commending Taiwan for its commitment to democratic elections and institutions despite ongoing threats from the CCP.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has encouraged U.S. colleges and universities to support the U.S.-Taiwan Education Initiative as an alternative to China’s propaganda-fueled Confucius Institutes that infiltrated around 100 college campuses.

Senator Blackburn is also keenly aware of China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which is why she visited Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea to promote American diplomacy and push back on Beijing’s growing influence in the region.


Blackburn on Taiwan Trip: We Are Working To Protect Pacific Island Nations From CCP's Aggression

During the 2019 Hong Kong protests when Beijing executed a takeover of the once autonomous region of Hong Kong, Senator Blackburn led bipartisan legislation prohibiting the U.S. export of crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force, which was signed into law by President Trump.

In 2020, after Beijing passed a law quashing freedom in Hong Kong and authorizing the political persecution of critics and dissenters under the guise of “national security,” Senator Blackburn sat down with democratic activist Nathan Law to discuss the implications of this crackdown on Hong Kong’s future.


Hong Kong Activist Nathan Law Discusses the National Security Law with Senator Blackburn

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has continually fought to end the CCP’s ongoing genocide against the Uyghur Muslims. She supported the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was signed into law in 2021, to ensure that goods made with the slave labor of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and elsewhere in Communist China do not enter the United States. She also led the Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act to prohibit the U.S. government from buying solar panels manufactured or assembled in Communist China and ensure no taxpayer dollars are being used to fuel the CCP’s genocide and human rights abuses. 

Additionally, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Senator Blackburn pressed her on the Treasury’s failure to issue new sanctions against the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary organization with a 50 percent or more stake in more than 2,800 companies in China.

China White Paper

Fighting for Tennesseans means unraveling our failed relationship with China. To repair the utter brokenness of Beijing’s relationship with the West, particularly the United States, Senator Blackburn released her China White Paper in 2020 — a comprehensive analysis examining the state of play and detailing the best ways to start that process. 

Key Recommendations:

The United States should maintain its participation in international organizations and work multilaterally to reshape Beijing’s participation in those organizations as China pursues a new model for intergovernmental institutions shaped by self-interest.

Congress should lead a whole-of-government approach to secure U.S. supply chains across sectors and bring critical manufacturing and technologies back to America.

The United States should address Chinese academic, research, and economic espionage, and intellectual property theft, through the introduction of new, responsibly stringent regulations and consistent implementation of existing regulations.

The United States should lead in international standards-setting for network security, emerging technologies, internet access and freedom, and other key policy areas. Key allies and partners should be encouraged to participate in the development and implementation of these standards.

Congress should continue to provide robust support for Taiwan and Hong Kong while supporting universal human rights standards across the Indo-Pacific and within China and its territories.

The United States should prioritize building a constellation of allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific in support of a rules-based order to deter aggression and foster stable economic growth.

Congress should promote increasing defense investment in U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) while building human capital enterprise-wide to augment regional deterrence and bolster arenas in which the U.S. possesses an asymmetric advantage.

Timeline of Senator Blackburn's Work

Senator Blackburn has a proven record of taking on Communist China. From creating the Congressional Songwriters Caucus in the House of Representatives in 2003, which helped to educate colleagues on the threat Chinese intellectual property theft poses to the creative community, to visiting Taiwan throughout her career in the House and in her first term as Senator nearly 20 years later, she has been steadfast in her efforts to hold the Chinese regime accountable and defend democracy around the world throughout her career in the United States Congress.

CRIME
As the radical Left seeks to implement soft-on-crime policies throughout the nation, there has been a surge in violent crime in recent years. Between 2016 and 2020 under the Trump administration, violent crime fell by 17%. Just in the first two years of the Biden administration, between 2020 and 2022, it soared by 43%. 

It’s no coincidence that this surge in violent crime across the nation comes as blue states and progressive district attorneys in Democrat-led cities push their radical soft-on-crime policies, including cashless bail and reduced prison sentences. After New York State implemented so-called bail reform in 2019, two-thirds of offenders out on bail with a prior violent felony arrest were arrested again within two years of arraignment, according to a recent study. Within just two-and-a-half months of the law’s enactment, crime in New York City rose 20% compared with the previous year, the Manhattan Institute found.

As far-left bail policies put the interests of criminals ahead of the interests of law enforcement, families, and hardworking taxpayers, Senator Blackburn has led several legislative initiatives aimed at restoring law and order in our communities. We must fund — not defund — the police, and always support our brave men and women in blue.


Senator Marsha Blackburn: If You Do The Crime, You Need To Do The Time

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Stop Violent Crime
After a wave of violent crime swept through Memphis, Tennessee, resulting in the death of Eliza  Fletcher and a string of shootings, Senators Blackburn and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) demanded President Biden take immediate action to ensure communities across the country are safe and secure. They introduced the Restoring Law and Order Act to increase resources for law enforcement and help reduce violent crime. Additionally, while the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office continues to spearhead bail reform that makes it easier for criminals to avoid pretrial detention, Senator Blackburn introduced the Keep Violent Criminals Off Our Streets Act to deter policies that prohibit bail and reward criminal acts. 

Senator Blackburn has also led legislation to reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act, which would help fight the rape kit backlog by providing state and local law enforcement agencies with resources to complete forensic analyses of crime scenes and untested rape kits.


Blackburn Criticizes Weak-On-Crime Prosecutors And Lenient Sentences That Make Cities More Dangerous

Tragically, much of the crime committed in Memphis is driven by juvenile offenders, who are committing more and more aggravated assaults, robberies, and carjackings against innocent city residents. After years of a steady decline in juvenile crime, in 2023 Shelby County saw a staggering 4,546 juvenile charges, up 37% from 2021. Across the country, 64% of violent juvenile crime happens on school days, peaking between 2 and 6 p.m.

To help combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan AFTER SCHOOL Act, which would establish a grant program for local communities to establish, maintain, and strengthen after school programs with the goal of reducing violent crime among juveniles.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn introduced a resolution recognizing the success of President Trump’s Operation Legend, which was instrumental in reducing and combating violent crime in ten of our nation’s largest cities — including Memphis. Given the levels of violent crime that are still plaguing several cities like Memphis, the resolution urges a future presidential administration to consider instituting a similar policy that deploys federal law enforcement agents to work with state and local law enforcement to target crime.

Furthermore, in advocating for the victims of violent crimes, Senator Blackburn supported the Victims’ VOICES Act. This legislation, which was signed into law, ensures that those who act on behalf of a victim during certain criminal court case proceedings receive restitution from convicted defendants, giving all victims the justice they deserve.

ENERGY
America is blessed with abundant natural resources that allow us to produce reliable, affordable energy. Yet, since his first day in office, President Biden has kowtowed to the Green New Deal agenda, waging a disastrous war on American energy independence and wrecking the American economy.

Since Inauguration Day, President Biden has issued dozens of regulations and executive orders that restrict energy production across our country.


Senator Blackburn Demands For Energy Independence Amid Soaring Gas Prices

Whether it’s canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, banning liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, obstructing oil and gas leasing on federal lands, draining our emergency petroleum reserves to four-decade lows, or imposing costly new regulations on drilling, President Biden has repeatedly put the demands of far-Left activists over the interests of Tennesseans and the American people.

As a result, families are paying more to heat their homes and fill up their cars. Under President Trump, the average price for a gallon of gas was $2.57. Under President Biden, gas prices reached an average high of $4.06 per gallon — the highest cost seen in over two decades.

At the same time, the Biden administration has tried to regulate every aspect of Americans’ lives, from the cars they can drive to the stovetops they can use to cook. This anti-energy crusade is not only eating away at Americans’ savings and pushing inflation to record highs; it's also emboldening our adversaries — including Russia and China — who are all too happy that President Biden is making America more dependent on their natural resources.

To lower prices at the pump and strengthen our security, America must unleash its energy production.


Marsha Blackburn On Rising Gas Prices: This Is Not Putin's Price Hike - It Is Joe Biden's

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Support American Energy
Senator Blackburn has consistently supported national energy policies that promote a diverse, domestic energy supply and reduce our dependence on foreign countries.

In early 2023, Senator Blackburn joined more than 20 of her Republican colleagues in demanding that the Biden administration reverse course on its plan to impose $100 billion in targeted tax increases on American energy, including the production of oil, gas, and coal.

Senator Blackburn also joined her colleagues and sent a letter outlining 12 specific actions that the Biden administration must take to lower fuel prices and strengthen our energy security, including restoring the Keystone XL Pipeline, fast-tracking energy projects on federal lands, and expediting the permitting of critical minerals.


Senator Blackburn Responds To Report That China May Buy Russian Energy

As President Biden pushes his radical agenda, Senator Blackburn has been a leader in defending Tennesseans’ freedoms from socialist regulations. In 2023, she led the fight against the administration’s proposed ban on gas ranges and stoves — an issue the White House ultimately backed down on.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn introduced the Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act to prohibit federal funds from being used to buy solar panels manufactured or assembled in Communist China, specifically the Xinjiang province, which is known for its human rights abuses against its Uyghur minority.

Additionally, after President Biden squandered our nation’s domestic energy production, Senator Blackburn fought to prevent the sale of American oil to our adversaries. In 2022, she introduced the No Emergency Crude Oil for Foreign Adversaries Act to ensure that reserves sold from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) are not exported to U.S. adversaries, including Communist China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

Senator Blackburn also supported the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act after the Biden administration paused approvals of pending applications for LNG exports. This legislation would immediately reverse President Biden’s ban and protect America’s economic and national security by depoliticizing the export of American LNG. She has also joined a resolution in the Senate calling on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its latest set of proposed power plant regulations that will force the closure of coal- and gas-fired power plants.

FIGHTING "WOKENESS"
Senator Blackburn believes that under the Constitution, all Americans must be treated equally. Yet, the radical Left is doing the exact opposite by pushing their “woke” agenda on the American people. From forcing divisive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives on companies, to pushing Critical Race Theory (CRT) in schools, reimagining Title IX to punish real girls, and implementing soft-on-crime policies in our communities, the Biden-Harris administration has sought to impose their radical social justice ideology on the nation.

The United States has come a long way in its effort to promote equality, and these “woke” initiatives seek to reverse our nation’s incredible progress. 


Marsha Blackburn: This Veto Tells Americans Biden Will Prioritize Funding Climate Change & ESG

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Stop “Wokeness”
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Initiatives

DEI is an initiative that has been co-opted by the radical Left to lead Americans to believe it will reduce discrimination and quell bias. In reality, the Left has hijacked DEI as part of their hidden agenda to pit Americans of different races, religions, and genders against each other.

Studies show that DEI programs accomplish the exact opposite of what the Left wants Americans to believe they do — a report by Harvard Business Review details how most diversity programs fail to increase diversity, and studies indicate that DEI can activate bias or spark a harmful backlash against workers. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission even reported a 20% increase in discrimination charges in FY22. In cases related to K-12 education, there was a 144% increase in complaints since 2021.


Blackburn: Americans Are Sick Of Wokeness Being Shoved Down Their Throats By Leftist Corporations

After President Biden sought to unfairly force taxpayers to foot the bill for federal DEI initiatives that do nothing but divide Americans, Senator Blackburn co-led the Dismantle DEI Act to eliminate federal DEI funding. 

Since Biden took office, the U.S. military has spent at least 5,889,082 man hours on DEI-related activities among other programs, and the Air Force spent at least $68 million on DEI initiatives in 2021 alone.

To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced two measures to make the U.S. military less “woke” by ensuring our military is focused on combating Communist China rather than accommodating servicemembers’ neopronouns, along with preventing military children from being indoctrinated by Department of Defense teachers. Yet, Senate Democrats blocked these measures. 


Blackburn Leads Colleagues In Military COVID Vaccine Mandate Repeal

Senator Blackburn has also fought back against woke mandates by the Biden administration that have pushed our military into the worst recruitment crisis in decades. After the Defense Department forced thousands of troops out of service with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, she led a measure in the FY2023 NDAA that successfully repealed this disastrous order. Senator Blackburn has also sought to strengthen morale and recruitment in our military, partnering with country music star Craig Morgan as he once again returned to serve our country.
Critical Race Theory in Schools

Critical Race Theory is a radical school of thought used by the political Left to assign racial significance to objectively neutral concepts like history and mathematics. This dangerous agenda insists that America is a racist country and teaches that all individuals are either oppressors or victims.

CRT creates a false narrative of division that pits Americans against each other. In many public schools, activists and teachers unions are demanding CRT lessons be taught in the name of social justice. Against the will of parents and teachers, proponents of CRT have made it their goal to inculcate this divisive mentality in our children. These lessons are disguised as “anti-racist,” but in reality they sow racial division.


On Unmuted With Marsha, Dr. Carol M. Swain: The Most Radical Thing You Can Do Is Speak The Truth

Tennesseans believe in equality and opportunity for all. Students should not be discriminated against on the basis of race under any circumstances. Senator Blackburn has been a leader in pushing back against this harmful ideology. In 2021, after the Department of Education proposed federal funding to support the teaching of radical and divisive curriculum like CRT, Senator Blackburn joined more than 30 of her Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution to condemn the use of CRT in K-12 schools and teacher training programs. 

Senator Blackburn has also pushed for legislation to prohibit federal funding for the “1619 Project.”


Woke School Agenda Is Unwanted

Erasing “Women” from The History Books

Over the last four years, the Biden-Harris administration has sought to undermine the integrity of women’s sports and Title IX — the landmark civil rights law that codified protections on the basis of sex. 

Particularly, Title IX opened the floodgates to allow women in sports by requiring equal resources for facilities, training, recruitment, and scholarships for female athletic programs. Because of Title IX’s passage over 50 years ago, women’s sports were revolutionized, and the number of female high school and college athletes exploded.

In response to the Left’s assault on real women, Senator Blackburn co-sponsored the Women’s Bill of Rights, which would legally define basic sex-based terms and protect single-sex spaces for women, including rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, athletic teams, locker rooms, and sororities.


Riley Gaines To Marsha Blackburn: No Girl Should Lose The Opportunity To Play Sports

Senator Blackburn also led over 25 of her Republican colleagues in introducing a resolution to recognize October 10 as ‘American Girls in Sports Day’ to celebrate the contributions made by women in changing the world of athletics. She also led over 20 of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter urging National Collegiate Athletic Association President Charlie Baker to update their student-athlete policy to ensure only biologically female students can participate in women’s sports.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has stood up to efforts by the radical Left to erase the word “woman” from the history books. Most notably, during Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2022, Senator Blackburn asked the judicial nominee a simple question: “Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman?’” Judge Jackson’s failure to answer the question sent shockwaves through the nation, indicating a belief that “woman” is too controversial a term for the Left to define.

HEALTH CARE
Tennessee stands as a leader in health care innovation, fueled by a robust and expanding health care industry. This leadership is driven by major health systems, renowned research institutions, and a thriving health technology sector. Tennesseans need market-based reforms that put patients — not federal bureaucrats — in the driver’s seat to expand access to affordable care, lower prices on pharmaceuticals, and increase transparency for patients. The issues facing our health care sector will not be solved in Washington, D.C., but in Tennessee.


Blackburn Stresses The Importance Of Telehealth For Tennesseans

Prioritizing Rural Health Care
70 of Tennessee’s 95 counties are considered rural. Senator Blackburn, co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, is committed to finding bipartisan solutions to improve access to rural health care. She introduced her bipartisan Rural Health Agenda aimed at addressing health care challenges in rural America to maintain quality care close to home. The Rural Health Agenda includes three separate bipartisan bills: 

The Rural Health Innovation Act;

The Rural America Health Corps Act, and;

The Save Rural Hospitals Act. 

Senator Blackburn’s Rural Health Agenda would allow health care facilities to expand their hours of operation and hire additional medical providers. It would also incentivize more health professionals to work in rural health facilities in exchange for forgiving medical school loans. Lastly, it would ensure that rural hospitals receive fair payment for the services they provide.

Additionally, as co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Senator Blackburn has introduced bipartisan legislation with her fellow rural health champions. These efforts include a resolution to recognize November 16, 2023, as National Rural Health Day in honor of the many dedicated rural health care providers and our nation’s patients who depend on their services, and the Rural Health Clinic Burden Reduction Act, which streamlines regulatory requirements and reduces administrative burdens on rural health clinics, enhancing their ability to provide essential health care services in underserved areas.


Fighting For Tennesseans' Health Care

Advancements In Health Care
Senator Blackburn has been a champion of expanding telehealth and helped lead the way for telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following her discussions with both the White House and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma about a key regulation that previously restricted the use of telemedicine, the administration announced important changes. As a result of Senator Blackburn’s advocacy, access to telehealth services has been transformative for rural and medically complex patients, breaking down barriers and providing critical access to care in some of the most remote areas. Senator Blackburn partnered with a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Telehealth Modernization Act to ensure these telehealth flexibilities are a permanent fixture in our health care system.  

While AI presents certain dangers, it can also be an important tool for innovation, including in the health care industry. Our health care innovators are making great achievements by developing predictive diagnosis, disease analysis, and new applications to address patient needs. Senator Blackburn sent a letter urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop a formalized payment pathway for algorithm-based health care services, which are FDA-cleared medical devices that rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning to produce clinical information to aid in patient diagnosis or treatment.


Blackburn Discusses How Tennessee Health Care Companies Are Using AI To Increase Quality of Care

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has supported seniors’ access to high-quality care by announcing the formation of a Medicare payment reform working group to investigate and propose long-term reforms to the physician fee schedule and make necessary updates to the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. Through this effort, Senator Blackburn is committed to creating a health care system that truly supports both providers and patients and meets the needs of all beneficiaries now and in the future.

Senator Blackburn continues to prioritize innovation and access to quality health care in Tennessee.


Senator Blackburn Speaks to the American Telemedicine Association

Lowering the Cost of Drugs and Preserving Senior Choice
As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Blackburn has positioned herself as one of the leaders on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) reform. For too long, PBMs have taken advantage of misaligned incentives in the pharmaceutical supply chain at the expense of taxpayers and seniors. Senator Blackburn has introduced three bills to lower prescription drug costs at the pharmacy counter and protect the ability of seniors to use their local pharmacies.

The Patients Before Middlemen (PBM) Act would de-link the compensation of PBMs from drug price and utilization to better align incentives that would help lower prescription drug costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

The Neighborhood Options for Patients Buying Medicines (NO PBMs) Act would improve options and access to prescription drugs for seniors and bring PBMs in alignment with Medicare plans, allowing seniors to shop at their local pharmacy.

The Pharmacy Access Oversight and Reporting Act would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish a report on enforcement and oversight actions taken to ensure compliance of Medicare’s pharmacy access requirements.

Senator Blackburn has also introduced the bipartisan Seniors’ Access to Critical Medicines Act which makes it easier for seniors with cancer and other serious illnesses to get access to medication. This commonsense bill ensures Medicare beneficiaries’ timely access to life-saving medicines, such as cancer drugs, by granting doctors the authority to mail medication to rural patients who cannot travel or allow caregivers to pick-up loved ones’ medication — making clear that doing so does not violate federal law.


"These Prescription Drugs Are Life or Death Issues," Says Blackburn

Fighting the Opioid Epidemic
Senator Blackburn has fought to support the State of Tennessee so that patients can continue to access much-needed treatment and care for substance use disorder.

Senator Blackburn has introduced the Securing Advances and a Variety of Evidence-Based (SAVE) Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Options Act. The bipartisan legislation allows Tennessee to provide treatment to patients suffering from substance use disorder in IMDs. 

She has also introduced bills to facilitate access to life-saving medication for opioid use disorder, including the Extending Access to Addiction Treatment Act, which would permanently expand coverage for medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder under Medicaid. Additionally, the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services (TREATS) Act would preserve the ability for access to telehealth services and treatment for opioid use disorder.

Children’s Health Care in Tennessee
Tennessee is home to several innovative hospitals and healthcare facilities dedicated to treating childhood illnesses. As a mother and grandmother, Senator Blackburn understands the crucial importance of ensuring parents and their children have access to quality, life-saving pediatric care.

 In the United States Senate, Senator Blackburn has been a strong advocate for legislation that streamlines access to essential medical care for children with complex medical conditions. She co-sponsored the Accelerating Kids’ Access to Care Act, a bipartisan measure designed to create a streamlined pathway for pediatric providers to enroll in multiple state Medicaid programs. This initiative aims to eliminate unnecessary delays, reduce administrative burdens, and ensure that children on Medicaid receive timely access to the specialized care they need.

 Additionally, Senator Blackburn led efforts to enhance access to surgical oral health care for Medicare patients, particularly children and adults with special needs. In 2023, Senator Blackburn worked with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and sent a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator, urging the agency to support access to essential dental surgical procedures by expanding the availability of operating room sites.

In Tennessee, the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University stands out as one of the nation's leading children's hospitals and the largest in the Southeast. Located in Nashville, it serves as Middle Tennessee’s first full-service children’s hospital and is ranked nationally in 10 specialties, offering the highest-level NICU and emergency care. Senator Blackburn has been a long-time supporter of the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital. As a young mother in Tennessee, she was one of the original organizers of the Friends & Fashion event, which fundraises and supports the patients and families of the Children’s Hospital through various activities and programs.

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis is another leading pediatric research hospital in Tennessee. During the Speak Now for Kids Family Advocacy Day in Washington, D.C., Senator Blackburn met with one of the hospital’s cancer survivors, who was the first adult survivor to advocate on behalf of St. Jude families, urging lawmakers on Capitol Hill to prioritize children’s health on a national level.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Human trafficking is among the fastest-growing illicit trades in the world, generating over $150 billion in profits each year. Current estimates place the number of human trafficking victims at around 28 million. While many of our friends and neighbors may perceive human trafficking to be an overblown third-world phenomenon, in reality, the modern-day slave trade is very real — and very pervasive — right here at home. Combating human trafficking remains one of Senator Blackburn’s top priorities. By coming together on a bipartisan basis, Congress can support the ongoing efforts in Tennessee and across the country to help relegate this modern-day slave trade to the dustbin of history.

Blackburn: Why Won't Democrats Join Me In Addressing Human Trafficking?

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Combat Human Trafficking
Fighting President Biden's Open Border Agenda

As President Biden’s border crisis continues to embolden cartels and human traffickers, Senator Blackburn has strongly opposed amnesty for all and the spread of sanctuary cities and states that operate as lawless havens for illegal immigrants. Secure countries have secure borders. A wall helps put a stop to the caravans of illegal immigrants trying to cross our border and blocks the flow of drugs, human trafficking, terrorists, and other dangerous criminals. Until we secure our border and ports of entry, every state in our nation will be a border state, and every town will be a border town.


Blackburn: Biden Admin Lost 85,000 Migrant Children & They Don't Seem To Care

Senator Blackburn has championed legislation aimed at combating human trafficking along the southern border. In April 2023, after learning that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lost track of at least 85,000 unaccompanied migrant children, Senator Blackburn pressed HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and the Biden administration over this gross incompetence and sent a series of letters demanding transparency to protect these innocent children.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn introduced the End Child Trafficking Now Act, which would require a DNA test to determine the familial relationship between illegal immigrants coming across the border and any accompanying children. As many as 30% of children DNA tested were found not to be related to the illegal immigrants posing as family members. Meanwhile, drug cartels and gangs use minors to falsely present themselves as family units and seek asylum at our southern border. This legislation would stop criminals in their tracks and help protect children from exploitation.

Furthermore, 1 in every 3 human trafficking victims is a child, and in 2019, ICE identified 600 children who were “recycled,” with one child being brought across the border as many as eight different times. Despite these statistics, current DHS regulation and federal law prohibit Border Patrol agents from fingerprinting children under the age of 14. To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the PRINTS Act, which would prevent child recycling by giving U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) the authority to fingerprint non-citizens under the age of 14.

Following Senator Blackburn’s visit to the Del Rio Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border in early 2023, she also introduced the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Traffickers Act to ensure human and drug traffickers cannot continue to defraud the American taxpayer while they await prosecution and conviction in the United States.


Why Are Pedophiles Who Took Jeffrey Epstein's Private Jet Being Protected?

Securing Justice for the Victims of Sex Trafficking Rings

For years, the American public has known about financier Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring. We know the abuse spanned decades and harmed untold numbers of vulnerable young girls, and we also know a large network of high-profile, high-dollar predators participated in this horrific abuse.

That’s why Senator Blackburn has repeatedly requested a subpoena for the complete, unredacted Epstein flight logs and Ghislaine Maxwell’s unredacted “little black book” of contacts and addresses, along with all documents and records from the FBI regarding Epstein and Maxwell. The American people deserve to know who flew on Epstein’s plane, who witnessed these crimes, and who potentially participated in his international sex trafficking ring.

Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation to curb the smuggling and trafficking of young women and girls. Unfortunately, trafficking disproportionately affects girls and women, and nearly one in every four victims of human trafficking in the United States is reported to be a child. Additionally, more than 90 percent of female trafficking victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation. The bipartisan SAVE Girls Act would provide states, local governments, and nonprofits with vital resources they need to train personnel, conduct rescues, and help save trafficking victims.

Additionally, one in four women will be a victim of domestic violence in her lifetime, and in the United States, three women are killed each day by an intimate partner. Some women, even at their most vulnerable and isolated, will continue going to the salon and building relationships with their cosmetologists. The SALONS Stories Act would incentivize training for cosmetologists and beauticians so that they can spot signs of domestic violence among their clients and get them the help they need. This initiative replicates a program in Tennessee, Shear Haven, that has helped countless girls and women.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn visited the Scarlet Rope Center in Jackson, Tennessee, to support victims of human trafficking. She discussed with leaders of the project their work that provides healing and restoration to female survivors of human trafficking who are 18 years and older.


Sen. Blackburn Questions Instagram CEO Over Criminal Traffickers Utilization Of Instagram

Holding Big Tech Accountable for Online Sexual Abuse

It is critical that children are protected from the online harms that platforms like Instagram and TikTok present, and Senator Blackburn is committed to holding abusers and Big Tech accountable. Instagram, owned by Meta, has become a connecting site for pedophiles, promoting illicit content of minors and advertising child sexual abuse material for sale.

In today’s technological age, children have become increasingly vulnerable to online sexual exploitation. There is an urgent need to address loopholes in reporting these crimes, which is why Senator Blackburn has led bipartisan legislation, the REPORT Act, to equip the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement with the resources they need to adequately respond to online sexual exploitation. Additionally, the bill adds sex trafficking of children and enticement crimes to the reporting obligations within 180 days of the bill’s enactment and increases penalties for failure to report exploitative content ($600K-$850K on the first offense; $850K-$1M on the second offense). On May 7, 2024, the REPORT Act was signed into law, making a major step forward in the fight to protect children online.

Following reports from survivors, advocates, and local law enforcement agencies that apps such as Uber and Lyft are increasingly used as vehicles for exploitation, Senator Blackburn joined a bipartisan effort to urge Uber and Lyft to take additional steps to prevent their services from being used to transport victims of human trafficking.

Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation to remove the statue of limitations for child sex abuse survivors. The bipartisan Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act of 2021, which passed both the U.S. Senate and House of Represenatvies, ensures that survivors of child sex abuse are able to seek justice under the federal civil remedy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, without being barred by statutes of limitation.

ISRAEL
Over 75 years ago, the United States was the first nation to recognize the Jewish state of Israel and affirm its right to exist. Now, in the face of senseless attacks by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists, we must again stand with Israel and reaffirm its right to defend itself. 

The Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as Hamas, is an extremist fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in the territories under Israeli control. Hamas' covenant, which was issued on August 18, 1988, promotes one ultimate goal — to destroy the State of Israel through Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.

Since 1979, Iran — the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism — has created proxy forces throughout the Middle East by supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist groups. Hamas has received as much as $150 million from Iran in one year, funds which are used to finance training, technology, and equipment.

We must continue to support our strongest ally in the Middle East and their right to defend themselves from these horrific attacks. The United States must provide Israel with every available resource — including sending any and all military assistance — to defend itself with overwhelming force against terrorists who will not stop until they are eliminated.


Blackburn Leads Senate Republicans On Freezing Biden's $6 Billion Payment To Iran

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Support Israel
Following the first attacks made by Hamas terrorists on the morning of October 7, 2023, Senator Blackburn immediately took action, calling on the Biden administration to send any arms necessary for Israel to protect and defend itself against terrorism.

Senator Blackburn took charge in leading members of the Tennessee delegation and 19 Senate colleagues and demanding the administration permanently freeze the $6 billion ransom payment to Iran. This deal was negotiated by the Biden administration as part of a prisoner swap — a move that served as the catalyst for Iran-backed Hamas terrorists to attack Israel.

We need to ensure the Biden administration will not release another dollar to Iran – even when the media attention on Israel dissipates – and send the $6 billion to Israel.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has asked the administration to convene the G7 nations to jointly sanction Iran, demanded answers for violations of Iran’s Nuclear Program, and called for the removal of Jake Sullivan as National Security Advisor.

Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation to halt all funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which has a history of being antisemitic and employing individuals affiliated with Hamas.


Blackburn Calls On Biden To Freeze $6 Billion Iran Transfer

The Biden Administration's Foreign Policy Failures
Since day one in office, Biden's position on Iran has always been appeasement.

The Biden administration knew sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Palestinians could bolster Hamas, yet President Biden sent the Palestinians $235 million in aid in 2021. 

Biden has chosen not to enforce many of the oil sanctions the U.S. previously imposed on Iran, freeing up cash for Iran to fund its terrorist proxies. 

As a result, Iranian oil production has increased substantially, and they are on track to produce the most oil since President Trump introduced sanctions in 2018. 

Biden has been desperate to negotiate another nuclear deal with Iran even though Tehran has been trying to assassinate former Trump administration officials. 

JOBS & ECONOMY
Senator Blackburn believes in freedom, free people, and free markets. She understands the surest path to economic growth is through a small, limited government that controls spending, promotes growth, and does not overburden its citizens with taxes and regulations.

As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Blackburn has fought for conservative, fiscally responsible tax policies. While inflation and tax rates have skyrocketed under the Biden administration, with a near 20% increase in prices across the board since Biden took office, Senator Blackburn has been a loud voice in the fight to get the federal government’s reckless spending under control.

Blackburn: Three Years On, Americans Continue to Suffer From Bidenflation

Senator Blackburn Supporting Small Businesses
Senator Marsha Blackburn recognizes the hard work of small businesses and firmly believes our small businesses are the backbone that keeps our economy thriving in communities across Tennessee.


Marsha Blackburn: Let Small Business Owners Do What They Do Best – Innovate And Create New Jobs

As small businesses make up over 99% of businesses in the Volunteer State, Senator Blackburn has prioritized legislation that gives back to local communities and keeps government regulation out of the way of small businesses. She has worked to lower Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fees and proposed slashing federal spending by 1%, 2%, and 5%. These cuts are targeted at non-defense, non-homeland security, and non-veterans affairs discretionary spending.

Additionally, after the IRS received $80 billion in funding from the Biden administration’s “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) to hire 87,000 IRS agents, legislation Senator Blackburn vehemently opposed, she introduced the IRS User Fee Reduction Act to stop the IRS from charging small businesses exorbitant user fees. Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation to prevent the IRS from using its $80 billion infusion of taxpayer dollars included in the IRA to squeeze more revenue out of hardworking taxpayers.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has introduced and fought for legislation that alleviates strains on the supply chain, which have had major consequences on our economy since the global supply chain crisis began in 2021. In early 2023, she introduced the bipartisan Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act, which would strengthen federal efforts to expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips by collaborating with federal agencies and state organizations.


Senator Blackburn: Tennesseans Are Better At Spending Their Own Money Than The Federal Government

As she meets with Tennesseans from across the state during her annual 95 County Tour, Senator Blackburn hears firsthand how low taxes, pro-business policies, and a less invasive government have spurred economic growth in Tennessee. As a member of the Tennessee State Senate, Senator Blackburn successfully led the effort to block a state income tax from being implemented in the Volunteer State.

Senator Blackburn has also recognized the negative effects of Washington’s out-of-control spending and rising prices as a result of Biden’s economic policies. According to a report by the Senate Joint Economic Committee, families in Tennessee spent $10,344 more in 2023 than in 2021 to buy the same goods and services.

In 2022, when the price of gasoline reached a 40-year high, Senator Blackburn introduced ten amendments to the Democrats’ nearly $739 billion tax and spending spree that would stop tax increases on small businesses and middle-income Americans, prevent policies that increase energy prices, and block the Chinese Communist Party from undermining American academic and agricultural interests.

Marsha Blackburn: Farmers Are Pillars In Our Communities

Furthermore, in early 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a new rule that would force hardworking business owners and farmers to finance President Biden’s broken asylum program. Senator Blackburn pushed back and led a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting that the Department withdraw the proposed rule, calling on the administration to support our nation’s agriculture industry.

Senator Blackburn believes Tennesseans are better at spending their own money than the federal government is at spending taxpayer money and stands firm that they should have the right to do so.

MILITARY AND VETERANS
America shines as a beacon of freedom in a dangerous world because of the powerful sacrifices our active-duty service members and veterans have made to preserve our freedom. Regardless of whether battles of the future are fought on land, air, sea, space, or cyberspace, our men and women in uniform need to be armed with the most advanced technology and best weaponry to defend our nation. When their service comes to an end, we must ensure that no veteran is left behind and all veterans receive the benefits and timely access to quality care that they deserve.

Blackburn Commemorates 80th Anniversary Of D-Day In Normandy

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Support Veterans
As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Blackburn has worked to honor the sacrifices that veterans and their families make. This issue is especially important to her because Tennessee is home to more than 400,000 veterans who have bravely served our country.

In early 2024, after reports emerged that the Biden administration was prioritizing medical care and benefits for illegal immigrants over veterans, Senator Blackburn pressed Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough for answers and introduced legislation that would block Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) resources from being used to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. Additionally, after learning that the VA elicited nearly $11 million in unjustified bonuses to senior executives within the department, Senator Blackburn led a letter calling for the immediate dismissal of the responsible officials for this egregious mishandling of taxpayer dollars.


Blackburn: Biden Is Prioritizing Migrants Over Veterans

Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation, the Veterans Health Care Freedom Act, that would make medical care more accessible for veterans who too often face weeks’ long wait times to access basic services. This bill would remove the VA from the community care referral process, allowing veterans to receive health care in their communities from a provider of their choice. Additionally, the VA Quality Health Care Accountability and Transparency Act would increase transparency from the VA by requiring them to make staffing and quality of care data of individual VA facilities publicly available on their website.

Furthermore, in 2021, Senator Blackburn’s bipartisan bill to improve the VA caregiver program was signed into law by President Trump. The TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act strengthens transparency and communication and formally recognizes caregivers of veterans by identifying any caregiver in the electronic health record of the veteran.

Blackburn On The Importance Of Getting Our Veterans The Care They Deserve

Senator Blackburn also led a bipartisan effort to address the challenges female veterans face when seeking mammogram services by expanding access to mobile mammography units, improving advanced mammography equipment, and enhancing outreach services to better publicize mammography services.

In the cybersecurity space, Senator Blackburn has worked to protect veterans from scams and malicious attacks. In 2022, her bipartisan Strengthening VA Cybersecurity Act was signed into law. This legislation protects veterans’ personal information, many of whom are seniors, from being leaked and targeted for scams by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to obtain an independent cybersecurity assessment of VA information systems and submit to Congress a plan to address the cybersecurity weaknesses found in the assessment.
What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Support Our Troops In Tennessee
Tennessee is blessed to be home to several military facilities, including Fort Campbell and  Arnold Air Force Base. Senator Blackburn is committed to ensuring that our service members have the resources they need to carry out their mission and defend our nation.

In the FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act, Senator Blackburn secured crucial priorities that will bolster our nation’s security and directly benefit Tennessee’s military families, including promoting innovative research and projects at facilities such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex, advancing cybersecurity, and supporting our service members with the largest pay raise in over 20 years. 

Senator Blackburn has also fought back against woke mandates by the Biden administration that have pushed our military into the worst recruitment crisis in decades. After the Defense Department forced thousands of troops out of service with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, she led a measure in the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act that successfully repealed this disastrous mandate.

As America faces greater threats in space from our adversaries, Senator Blackburn also led legislation to establish a Space Force National Guard and prepare America to take on the challenges from the New Axis of Evil: Communist China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea.


Blackburn Leads Colleagues In Military COVID Vaccine Mandate Repeal

Blackburn Secures Wins for Tennessee
As Communist China and their fellow New Axis of Evil members continue to escalate their aggression, it’s vital our military stands ready. As such, we succeed by supporting servicemembers and their families, promoting innovative research, advancing cybersecurity, and providing our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to fight and win.

Senator Blackburn fought to secure vital wins in the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that will bolster our nation’s security and Tennessee’s military and research communities.

Key Points on Senator Blackburn's Work:

Support the Pathfinder Program by encouraging additional funding for defense capabilities and partnering with private sector developers at Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville;

Support the classified additive manufacturing partnership between the Air Force Research Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory for future Air Force assets, including at Arnold Air Force Base;

Secure funding to support a multipurpose training range at Fort Campbell that trains and tests the skills necessary to detect, identify, and defeat stationary infantry and stationary or moving armor targets in a tactical array;

Authorize funding for CH-47 Block II Chinook Helicopters, including those flown at Fort Campbell;

Provide funding for the planning and design of a new air traffic control tower at Fort Campbell;

Authorize the construction of the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex;

Support projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), including autonomous vehicle research at Tennessee Tech University;

Support the Cavitation Erosion Research project between the University of Memphis and the Memphis Detachment of Naval Surface Warfare Center, which studies cavitation erosion on combat ships and other vessels at the William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel (LCC) at Carderock’s Memphis Detachment, one of the world's largest and most technically advanced high-speed, variable-pressure water tunnel facilities; and

Include report language addressing the establishment of a pilot program to provide DoD with qualified civilian personnel to ensure the U.S. has the talent to address cyber vulnerabilities.

This builds upon Blackburn’s bipartisan measure in the FY2021 NDAA that created a pilot program allowing the National Guard to provide “rapid, remote response for cyber assistance” to state and local governments, along with critical infrastructure entities when they are hit with cyberattacks.

NATIONAL SECURITY
In a perilous and ever-changing global landscape, America stands as a beacon of freedom. In areas dominated by authoritarian regimes, those advocating for fundamental human rights find solace in America’s unwavering determination to champion democratic principles. Extending support to our allies conveys a potent message about our steadfast dedication to freedom. 

The New Axis of Evil — China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — is conspiring to destroy America. Yet, since day one, the Biden administration has put America’s safety at risk. Just days after taking office, President Biden announced a return to diplomacy with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, revoked the Houthis’ foreign terrorist designation, and removed travel restrictions on Iranian “diplomats.”

Additionally, the Biden administration has continuously kowtowed to the Iranian regime by allowing Tehran to export oil to Communist China, granting waivers for a $10 billion nuclear deal between Iran and Russia, and failing to respond to the Iranian regime’s attacks on U.S. soldiers. Under the Biden administration, the New Axis of Evil is winning now more than ever, and our national security is being compromised time and time again. 

Senator Blackburn has worked to prioritize America’s national security by ensuring a strong U.S. military, supporting our allies, and standing up for freedom across the globe.


The U.S. Has A Long History Of Standing For Freedom And Self-Determination

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Advocate for America's Safety
On Iran

On the anniversary of September 11th, the Biden administration sought to unfreeze $6 billion in assets for Iran in a deal to swap prisoners. Only weeks later, on October 7th, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched an unprovoked assault on Israel — the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Senator Blackburn immediately took action, leading nearly all of the Tennessee delegation in a letter to President Biden urging his administration to support Israel however possible — including by providing any weapons and munitions necessary and punishing all involved in aiding the Hamas terrorists. She also led 19 of her Senate Republican colleagues in demanding that President Biden and the State Department immediately rescind the waivers that allowed Iranian funds to be converted and moved to more accessible bank accounts.

In 2024, Senator Blackburn led an effort with Senator Marshall (R-Kan.) on the Senate floor to immediately provide Israel with $17.6 billion in aid needed to continue their fight against terrorism, which was ultimately blocked by Senate Democrats.

Furthermore, since taking office, President Biden has sent the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) around $1 billion, despite clear links between UNRWA and terrorism and knowing there would be a high risk of Hamas benefiting from American aid. In response to this, Senator Blackburn introduced legislation to halt all U.S. funding for UNRWA.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn’s bipartisan resolution to strengthen the economic ties between the U.S. and Israel passed the U.S. Senate in late 2023 following the October 7th attacks.


Blackburn: Sending Iran Cash Means Funding Hamas And Hezbollah

Senator Blackburn has also led legislation designed to weaken Iran’s connections with Communist China. The Iran China Accountability Act prohibits the consideration and use of any U.S. taxpayer dollars to advance a nuclear agreement with Iran until they terminate their ties with the CCP and terrorist groups like Hamas.

In response to the rise in anti-Israel protests on college campuses, Senator Blackburn introduced a bipartisan resolution that denounces antisemitism at institutions of higher education and pushes college and university leaders, administrators, and faculty to voice their opposition to antisemitism on campus. This effort passed the U.S. Senate in late 2023.

Blackburn: UNRWA Teaches Palestinian Children To Hate Jews

On China

Throughout her career in the United States Congress, Senator Blackburn has consistently raised concerns about Communist China’s increasing threat to the West. She strongly supported the Hong Kong freedom fighters during the 2019 protests, and her bipartisan legislation prohibiting the U.S. export of crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump.

Communist China’s ultimate goal is global domination. Since President Biden’s first day in office, the CCP’s aggression towards the U.S. has increased, and our national security has been greatly endangered.

Under Biden’s watch, the Chinese regime has sent spy balloons into our airspace, worked with cartels to flood our country with fentanyl, bought up American farmland near sensitive U.S. government facilities, weaponized TikTok to collect Americans’ private data, and challenged democracy around the world.


Communist China Is Using AI To Grow The Surveillance State

In June 2023, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Stemming The Operation of Pernicious and Illicit (STOP Illicit) Drones Act to limit the presence of Chinese-produced drones in the United States and keep our nation safer. Senator Blackburn also fought to secure vital national security wins in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act. In 2024, her measure to prohibit the FAA from funding foreign drone companies or procuring drones from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba was signed into law.

Additionally, amid the recent surge in Chinese nationals attempting to cross the southern border, Senator Blackburn led her Republican colleagues in introducing the No Asylum for CCP Spies Act to prohibit members of communist or totalitarian parties, like the CCP, from being granted asylum in the U.S.

Senator Blackburn has also advocated for banning TikTok in the United States or divesting the company from its Chinese Communist-owner.  Following reports alleging that TikTok has stored the sensitive financial information of U.S. TikTok creators in China, including social security numbers and tax information, Senator Blackburn led a letter to the company demanding transparent answers.

Blackburn On TikTok In Nashville: I Don't Want A Communist Chinese Spy Agency Setting Up Shop

On Taiwan

As Communist China continues to seek domination over Taiwan, Senator Blackburn has been a staunch defender of independence for the Indo-Pacific nation. In August 2022, Senator Blackburn visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei and called to strengthen connections between the U.S. and Taiwan. During this visit, Senator Blackburn made it clear: Taiwan is a country.


Senator Blackburn Meets With Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-Wen in Taipei to Further Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Nations and Calls Taiwan a Country, 8.26.22

In early 2024, Senator Blackburn supported a bipartisan resolution commending Taiwan for its commitment to democratic elections and institutions, despite ongoing threats from the Chinese Communist Party.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has encouraged U.S. colleges and universities to support the U.S.-Taiwan Education Initiative as an alternative to China’s propaganda-fueled Confucius Institutes, and has also introduced the Taiwan Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. This legislation supports the United States’ partnership with Taiwan by authorizing a defense lend or lease program with the Government of Taiwan, which will help ensure Taiwan has the capacity to defend itself and strengthen the United States’ commitment to preserving freedom around the globe.

PROTECTING LIFE
Life is precious and worth defending at all stages, which is why Senator Blackburn has strongly fought to protect unborn children and help expecting mothers.

Throughout her career in public service, Senator Blackburn has been an ardent champion of the pro-life movement and notably spearheaded the investigation into the illegal and gruesome practice of selling baby body parts as Chair of the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. Her persistence on the issue resulted in fifteen criminal referrals.  

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has consistently supported legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation's single largest provider of abortions.

Marsha Blackburn Sets The Record Straight on What Reversing Roe v. Wade Means

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing to Fight For the Unborn
Senator Blackburn believes so strongly in protecting the unborn that she introduced the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act as her first legislative action after being sworn in to the U.S. Senate in 2019. This bill would close the federal loophole that allows Big Abortion providers like Planned Parenthood to receive taxpayer dollars.

While Big Abortion groups claim that the federal funds they receive are not used for abortions, money is fungible, and the American people deserve to know whether their hard-earned dollars are being used to aid this life-ending practice. In 2022, Senator Blackburn led 144 of her congressional colleagues in requesting the Government Accountability Office (GAO) produce a report detailing all federal funding for Planned Parenthood and its Big Abortion affiliates. This report, which was released in December 2023, revealed that nearly $2 billion in federal taxpayer funding had been funneled to abortion providers between FY2019-FY2021.


Senator Blackburn Praises Pro-Life Movement Following The Dobbs Decision

Senator Blackburn believes Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) was a major victory for life that returned the power to We the People and gave each state the authority to create laws to protect life. Following the Supreme Court’s momentous ruling, she introduced a resolution celebrating the pro-life movement and the volunteers who have supported mothers and children for the past 50 years.

In 2022, Senator Blackburn introduced the Unborn Child Support Act to allow mothers to receive child support payments while they are pregnant and ensure access to necessary financial resources. She also celebrated pro-life volunteers, renewed her pledge to continue fighting for the unborn, and called on states to help protect life.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn has introduced legislation aimed at protecting pregnant women and unborn children by providing adequate medical information for informed consent before abortions. The Woman’s Right To Know Act sets reasonable medical standards for physicians to meet to protect both the life of the mother and the child before an abortion can be performed.

Pro-Life Activist Speaks On Protecting The Unborn

Senator Blackburn has also supported the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which passed the House of Representatives in 2023 and would require health care practitioners to provide a child born alive following an attempted abortion the same degree of care as any other newborn. She has also advocated for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban, which became law and prohibits any medical provider from performing a partial-birth abortion.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn successfully pushed for the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004, which was signed into law and created an additional federal offense for killing or injuring an unborn child. She has supported legislation to prohibit discrimination-by-abortion against unborn children with Down syndrome, as well as legislation preventing abortion on the basis of sex.

Senator Blackburn has also consistently worked to protect underage women and their unborn children. She has supported the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which would make it a federal crime to transport a minor across a state line to obtain an abortion, along with the Parental Notification and Intervention Act of 2003 to require minors to gain parental consent before obtaining an abortion, with limited exceptions.

TECHNOLOGY
Senator Blackburn is optimistic about how developing technologies are breaking barriers in the financial, auto manufacturing, and healthcare industries — all of which are critical to Tennessee’s economy. In Congress, she has continuously fought to protect Americans’ “virtual you” and put consumers in control of their data. At the same time, Senator Blackburn has helped expand access to broadband for rural Tennesseans. You can’t have 21st-century healthcare, 21st-century education, or a 21st-century economy without 21st-century internet that can be accessed by Tennesseans regardless of their zip code.

Harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) fosters innovation in our state and creates opportunities for rural areas. While AI can be used for tremendous good, it can and has already been exploited by bad actors. Communist China is pouring tremendous resources into this technological breakthrough with the goal of controlling the AI market by 2030. Senator Blackburn is committed to working with colleagues across the aisle in Washington and developing a plan to facilitate domestic innovation in AI and ensure we outpace our adversaries in this critical field.

The Kids Online Safety Act
U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have championed the bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act, comprehensive legislation to protect children online and hold Big Tech accountable. 

When children are online, they are the product, and addiction is the business model. The Kids Online Safety Act provides young people and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to protect against online harms. The bill requires social media platforms to put the well-being of children first, ensuring an environment that is safe by default. The legislation requires third party audits and independent research to ensure that social media platforms are taking meaningful steps to address risks to kids.


Blackburn To Zuckerberg, Big Tech CEOs: How Much Is A Child's Life Worth To You?

Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal first introduced the Kids Online Safety Act in February 2022 after spearheading a series of five subcommittee hearings with social media companies and advocates on tech giants’ repeated failures to protect kids on their platforms and the dangers kids face online. The bill passed the U.S. Senate in July 2024, with 91 Senators voting in favor of the bipartisan legislation.

For more on the Kids Online Safety Act, click here.
Protecting Children From Online Sexual Exploitation
It is critical that children are protected from the online harms platforms like Instagram and TikTok present, and Senator Blackburn is committed to holding abusers and Big Tech accountable. Instagram, owned by Meta, has become a connecting site for pedophiles, promoting illicit content of minors and advertising child sexual abuse material for sale.

Beyond the Kids Online Safety Act, Senator Blackburn has led bipartisan legislation, including the REPORT Act, to equip the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement with the resources they need to adequately respond to online sexual exploitation. This legislation, which requires Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram to report crimes against children involving sex trafficking, grooming, or the enticement of children for sexual acts to NCMEC’s CyberTipline, was signed into law on May 7, 2024, marking a major step forward in the fight to protect children online.


End Online Child Exploitation: How The REPORT Act Will Help Americans

Additionally, following reports from survivors, advocates, and local law enforcement agencies that ridesharing companies are increasingly used as vehicles for exploitation, Senator Blackburn joined bipartisan letters to Uber and Lyft, calling on the ride-hailing apps to take additional steps to prevent their services from being used to transport victims of human trafficking. 

As more and more Americans take advantage of rideshare services, there is an urgent need to balance driver safety with passenger privacy when it comes to the use of dashcams. Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Safe and Private Rides Act, which would prevent rideshare drivers from violating passengers’ privacy by requiring transportation network companies to notify passengers when their driver has a video recording device in the car and give passengers the opportunity to opt out of riding with a driver with a dashcam.

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Protect Music City
Senator Blackburn has been a champion for Music City throughout her career in public service. She understands that while technology offers artists the ability to reach greater audiences and connect with listeners, it also increases the risk of unfair compensation and unauthorized replication of their likeness by AI.

Senator Blackburn Meets With the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) in Washington, D.C.

Senator Blackburn has fought to ensure singer-songwriters are properly compensated for their talent and hard work. In 2023, she introduced the bipartisan American Music Fairness Act, which ensures artists and music creators receive fair compensation for the use of their songs on AM/FM radio by bringing corporate radio broadcasters in line with all other music streaming platforms.

Senator Blackburn believes artists deserve the right to own their name, image, and likeness. The bipartisan NO FAKES Act will protect the voice and visual likenesses of individuals from unfair use through generative AI.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has long advocated for tougher action on trademark protections for music in the Chinese market. As Communist China seeks to violate copyright law in the United States, it is imperative that we fight for our creative community to ensure songwriters are properly compensated for their hard work.

How Artificial Intelligence Impacts The Music Industry: Blackburn

Strengthening Our Nation’s Cybersecurity
Senator Blackburn has led several pieces of legislation aimed at strengthening cybersecurity in the United States. As part of the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Senator Blackburn created a pilot program to allow the National Guard to provide “rapid, remote response for cyber assistance” to state and local governments, along with critical infrastructure entities when they are hit with cyberattacks.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn’s bipartisan Open Technology Fund Authorization Act, which was signed into law through the FY21 NDAA, plays a critical role in U.S. efforts to address the increasing levels of Internet censorship and surveillance. The legislation helped to expand the U.S. government’s support for internet freedom by addressing authoritarian regimes’ escalating efforts to censor, restrict, and surveil the internet.

In 2022, Senator Blackburn’s bipartisan Strengthening VA Cybersecurity Act was signed into law. This legislation protects veterans’ personal information, many of whom are seniors, from being leaked and targeted for scams by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to obtain an independent cybersecurity assessment of VA information systems and submit to Congress a plan to address the cybersecurity weaknesses found in the assessment. 

Additionally, Senator Blackburn led a bipartisan package of bills as part of the FY24 NDAA that would strengthen our nation’s cybersecurity workforce and support the federal response to cyber threats. These bipartisan bills would establish Civilian Cybersecurity Reserve pilot programs within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to recruit qualified civilian cybersecurity personnel to serve in reserve capacities to ensure the U.S. government has the talent needed to defeat, deter, or respond to malicious cyber activity.

Sen. Blackburn Demands Answers On Worldwide Threats In Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing

Bridging Gaps Between Manufacturing & Technology
Senator Blackburn has several pieces of legislation aimed at bridging gaps in the manufacturing and technology sectors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, deep vulnerabilities in our country's national supply chains were exposed, causing major disruptions to our long-term economic recovery. To combat this, Senator Blackburn introduced the National Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Supply Chain Database Act, which became law as part of the CHIPS and Science Act, to establish a national database with information about the interconnectivity of manufacturers in the United States supply chain. The database will help prevent future supply chain disruptions by offering manufacturers key information as they make decisions on how to retool in critical areas to meet the demand for key products, such as defense supplies, food, and medical devices.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn’s bipartisan legislation to expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips — the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act — unanimously passed the U.S. Senate. This bill would direct the U.S. Department of Commerce’s SelectUSA program to develop strategies to attract investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturers and supply chains and engage with state-level economic development organizations about how they are attracting foreign direct investment to onshore activities related to semiconductor manufacturing.

Senator Blackburn has also introduced the bipartisan Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act, which would create a supply chain disruption early warning mechanism at the U.S. Department of Commerce using artificial intelligence and quantum hybrid computing to identify potential supply chain shocks before they occur.

Paving the Way for Quantum Applications
Tennessee is home to quantum applications that have become critical as our nation competes on the global stage. Senator Blackburn has fought to pave the way for quantum development in the U.S. Senate, leading several pieces of legislation to bolster the United States’ dominance in this critical space.

While Communist China has publicly acknowledged their goal to lead the world in quantum communications by 2049, it’s critical the United States provide an environment for entrepreneurs and companies to promote competition and continued innovation. Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Quantum Sandbox for Near-Term Applications Act to establish a public-private partnership for near-term quantum application development and acceleration, and also has bipartisan legislation to encourage quantum manufacturing in the United States.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn introduced the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, bicameral legislation that would supercharge the Department of Defense’s approach to quantum technology and advance U.S. national security, building on the work done at institutions like Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

THE KIDS ONLINE SAFETY ACT
What is the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)?


It’s no secret that children and teenagers are more glued to their screens than ever before. Children ages 8 to 12 spend an average of over 5 hours per day on their screens, while teenagers log over 8 hours every day. When your child is online, they are the product, and Big Tech is trying every method possible to keep them scrolling, clicking ads, and sharing every detail of their life.

In today’s age of social media, the statistics on mental health issues among youth are staggering. Almost half of U.S. teens have experienced bullying or harassment online. Between 2010 and 2019, teen depression rates doubled, with teenage girls seeing the sharpest increase. In 2021, almost a third of girls said they seriously considered attempting suicide.

Since Big Tech refuses to protect our children, it’s time for Congress to step in.

The Kids Online Safety Act Will Keep Our Children Safer
The bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed the U.S. Senate 91-3, provides young people and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to protect against online harms. The bill requires social media platforms to put the well-being of children first by providing an environment that is safe by default.

Specifically, the Kids Online Safety Act:

Requires social media platforms to provide minors with options to protect their information, disable addictive product features, and opt out of personalized algorithmic recommendations.

Platforms are required to enable the strongest privacy settings for kids by default.

Gives parents new controls to help protect their children and spot harmful behaviors, and provides parents and educators with a dedicated channel to report harmful behavior.
Creates a duty for online platforms to prevent and mitigate specific dangers to minors, including promotion of suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, sexual exploitation, and advertisements for certain illegal products (e.g. tobacco and alcohol).

Ensures that parents and policymakers know whether online platforms are taking meaningful steps to address risks to kids by requiring independent audits and research into how these platforms impact the well-being of kids and teens.

Fact vs. Fiction

Could the Kids Online Safety Act give state Attorneys General or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the power to dictate what kind of content young users see on social media or other online platforms?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act does not give state Attorneys General or FTC the power to bring lawsuits over content or speech. The Kids Online Safety Act would not censor, block, or remove any content from the internet.

What is the “duty of care” in the Kids Online Safety Act and why is it important?
The “duty of care” requires social media companies to prevent and mitigate certain harms that they know their platforms and products are causing to young users as a result of their own design choices, such as their recommendation algorithms and addictive product features. The specific covered harms include suicide, eating disorders, substance use disorders, and sexual exploitation.

What kinds of harms does the “duty of care” in the Kids Online Safety Act cover?
The duty of care only applies to a fixed and clearly established set of harms, and sets a high standard for what online platforms can be held accountable for.

Does the Kids Online Safety Act require platforms to block or take down content?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act does not make online platforms liable for the content they host or choose to remove.

Would the Kids Online Safety Act prevent young users from searching for and accessing helpful resources online?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act actually includes an express provision ensuring that a company cannot be liable for providing content to young users when the user has searched for that content. And, in order to ensure that mental health support services are protected and encouraged, the bill provides explicit protections for those services (ex. National Suicide Hotline, substance abuse organizations, or LGBTQ youth centers).

Does the Kids Online Safety Act require age verification or force users to provide their drivers’ license or government ID to create social media accounts?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act does not impose age verification requirements or require platforms to collect more data about users (government IDs or otherwise).

But how can the Kids Online Safety Act require protections for users under a certain age without checking how old they are?
Under the Kids Online Safety Act, if an online platform already knows that a user is underage, then it has to provide the safety and privacy protections required by the legislation—the platform cannot bury its head in the sand when it knows a user is underage.

Does the Kids Online Safety Act require teenagers to get their parents’ permission to go online?
No, teenage users don’t need permission to create new accounts or go online. The bill does require permissions and safeguards for young children, those under the age of 13, similar to existing law under COPPA.

Does the Kids Online Safety Act put children under surveillance or harm the safety and privacy of minors?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act doesn’t require the disclosure of private information such as browsing history, messages, or friends lists, to parents or other users.

Does the Kids Online Safety Act cover all websites, including blogs?
No, the Kids Online Safety Act only covers social media, social networks, multiplayer online video games, social messaging applications, and video streaming services. It does not include blogs or personal websites.

Does the Kids Online Safety Act cover platforms run by non-profit organizations?
No, websites run by non-profits organizations – which often host important and valuable educational and support services – are not covered by the scope of the legislation.

Bipartisan Support for KOSA


The Kids Online Safety Act Has Broad Bipartisan Support
Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal first introduced the Kids Online Safety Act in February 2022 following reporting by the Wall Street Journal and after spearheading a series of five subcommittee hearings with social media companies and advocates on the repeated failures by tech giants to protect kids on their platforms. Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal have stood their ground in the face of aggressive lobbying and flagrant lies from Big Tech companies, uniting 72 members of the U.S. Senate and gathering the endorsements of over 240 organizations, including parents, child safety advocates, tech experts, faith leaders, pediatricians, and child psychologists in support of the legislation. The bill passed the U.S. Senate in July 2024, with 91 Senators voting in favor of the bipartisan legislation.

As the first woman to represent the state of Tennessee in the United States Senate, Senator Blackburn has been a trailblazer for women throughout her distinguished career. Her leadership philosophy is based on her experiences in the private sector as a small businesswoman, mother and grandmother.

Senator Blackburn attended college on a 4-H scholarship. She worked her way through school by selling books for the Southwestern Company as one of their first female sales associates, and later as one of their first female sales managers. Building on that experience, she then founded her own business, Marketing Strategies, which focused on the retail marketplace, as well as electronic and print media.

Upon beginning her career in public service in 1995, Senator Blackburn helped pave the way for women and has prioritized crafting legislation that empowers and protects women on a broad range of issues, from Title IX and women’s sports to human trafficking, female veterans’ access to health care, and more.

What Senator Blackburn Is Doing To Support Women
Since taking public office, Senator Blackburn has ardently fought to protect women and children. In 1999, she helped found the Davis House, a center to help children being abused, and has also supported initiatives such as the Scarlet Rope Center in Jackson, Tennessee, to assist victims of human trafficking. She discussed with leaders of the project their work that provides healing and restoration to female survivors of human trafficking who are 18 years and older.

One in four women will be a victim of domestic violence in her lifetime, and in the United States, three women are killed each day by an intimate partner. However, some women, even at their most vulnerable and isolated, will continue going to the salon and building relationships with their cosmetologists. The SALONS Stories Act would incentivize training for cosmetologists and beauticians so that they can spot signs of domestic violence among their clients and get them the help they need. This initiative replicates a program in Tennessee, Shear Haven, that has helped countless girls and women.

Furthermore, human trafficking disproportionately affects girls and women, and more than 90 percent of female trafficking victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation. Senator Blackburn has been a leader in the fight to end this modern-day slavery and curb the smuggling and trafficking of young women and girls.

In 2023, Senator Blackburn led an all-female delegation with Senators Katie Britt (R-Ala.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) to the Del Rio Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, where they witnessed firsthand human smugglers leading illegal immigrants across the border and into the United States. The Senators held a roundtable where they learned about cartel activity in Mexico and the work being done to rescue victims of human trafficking.

Following her trip, Senator Blackburn introduced the bipartisan SAVE Girls Act, which would provide states, local governments, and nonprofits with vital resources they need to train personnel, conduct rescues, and help save trafficking victims.


Blackburn, Hyde-Smith, Britt Expose Harsh Reality Of Biden’s Border Crisis

Under the Biden administration's radical agenda, President Biden has attempted to undermine the integrity of women’s sports and Title IX — the landmark civil rights law that codified protections on the basis of sex. 

Particularly, Title IX opened the floodgates to allow women in sports by requiring equal resources for facilities, training, recruitment, and scholarships for female athletic programs. Because of Title IX’s passage over 50 years ago, women’s sports were revolutionized, and the number of female high school and college athletes exploded.

However, President Biden’s relentless assault on women in the athletic space has led to a complete and total erosion of Title IX’s protections under his administration. In 2022, on the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the Department of Education announced a set of new rules that formally enshrined the ability of students to participate in activities that do not align with their sex, essentially forcing schools to allow biological males to play on female teams. In 2024, the administration redefined “discrimination” to allow biological men to use women-only locker rooms and bathrooms.

Senator Blackburn has co-sponsored the Women’s Bill of Rights, which would legally define basic sex-based terms and protect single-sex spaces for women, including rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, athletic teams, locker rooms, and sororities.

Following this “reimagination” of Title IX, Senator Blackburn slammed the Biden administration and sent letters to President Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Corona condemning the new rules that will harm young girls and women. Additionally, Senator Blackburn led over 20 of her Republican colleagues in introducing a resolution to recognize October 10 as ‘American Girls in Sports Day’ to celebrate the contributions made by women and changing the world of athletics.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has stood up to efforts by the radical Left to erase the word “woman” from the history books. Most notably, during then-Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2022, Senator Blackburn asked the judicial nominee a simple question: “Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman?’” Judge Jackson’s failure to answer the question sent shockwaves through the nation, indicating a belief that “woman” is too controversial a term for the Left to define.

Furthermore, Senator Blackburn has been an ardent champion for women in the pro-life space.

Following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2022, Senator Blackburn introduced the Unborn Child Support Act to give mothers the ability to receive child support payments while they are pregnant and ensure access to necessary financial resources. 

Senator Blackburn has also introduced legislation aimed at protecting the health of pregnant women and unborn children by providing adequate medical information for informed consent before abortions. The Woman’s Right To Know Act sets reasonable medical standards for physicians to meet to protect both the life of the mother and the child before an abortion can be performed.

Additionally, Senator Blackburn understands that supporting mothers is critical to defending life at all stages. To promote access to quality health care and financial support for mothers, she joined the More Opportunities for Moms to Succeed (MOMS) Act, which would provide critical support to women during typically challenging phases of motherhood – prenatal, postpartum, and early childhood development – and bolster access to resources and assistance to help mothers and their children thrive. Senator Blackburn has also introduced the Baby Changing on Board Act, which would support mothers by requiring all new Amtrak trains to be equipped with baby changing stations.

Marsha Blackburn Sets The Record Straight on What Reversing Roe v. Wade Means

As the first woman elected to represent the state of Tennessee in the United States Senate, Senator Blackburn has led several pieces of legislation to commemorate the accomplishments of women throughout history. In 2019, her bipartisan Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, honoring the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote and the legacy of the suffrage activists, was signed into law by President Trump.

Additionally, among the 40 monuments, memorials, statues and historic sites on the National Mall, there is not one dedicated to an American woman. Senator Blackburn has introduced the bipartisan Women's Suffrage National Monument Location Act to commemorate the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and secure a monument honoring women’s history in the sacred location.
