Hardworking Americans have funded this administration’s blunders to the tune of BILLIONS.
 
From the border crisis to Afghanistan, to Putin’s war in Ukraine &amp; Hamas terrorists’ attacks on Israel, Biden-Harris has failed at every turn and forced Americans to pay for the fallout.

As I say twice a year — pick a time and stick with it. 

Changing the clocks is an outdated practice that costs the United States hundreds of millions of dollars each year &amp; has negative effects on Americans’ health.

Israel is the United States’ greatest friend and ally in the Middle East.
 
Why has the Biden-Harris administration failed to fully commit itself to protecting the Jewish state?

2024-11-01T23:52:52.000Z
Under the Biden-Harris open border, we’ve seen:
 
— Americans killed by fentanyl &amp; criminal illegals
— Women and children smuggled by traffickers
— Potential terrorists slip through the cracks

Only 12,000 jobs were created in the entire month of October under Biden-Harris, and 46,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.

This administration has been a disaster from start to finish.

2024-11-01T14:21:09.000Z
Since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, more than 10.3 MILLION illegals have entered our nation.

They have no intention of securing the border or keeping our communities safe.

Inflation in September had its biggest monthly gain since April.

Americans cannot afford rising prices caused by the Biden-Harris administration’s reckless spending.

Average gas prices in America are up to $3.41 per gallon.

That is $1 higher than when Biden &amp; Harris took office. This administration is crippling Americans’ ability to provide for their families.

2024-08-22T01:42:58.000Z
The Biden-Harris Labor Department is being forced to walk back their claim that they created more than 800,000 jobs.

This is the largest negative revision since 2009.

Biden &amp; Harris flat out lied to the American people, and the legacy media helped them get away with it.

2024-08-21T23:03:17.000Z
The Biden-Harris administration:

— Brought Americans 40-year high inflation
— Opened the southern border up to over 10 million illegals
— Weakened American energy

2024-08-21T21:23:53.000Z
As Americans continue to be massacred by criminals illegally crossing our southern border, Border Czar Kamala Harris supports mass amnesty.

All approved by the Biden-Harris administration.

I’d like to thank my colleagues and the countless parents and organizations that have helped get this landmark legislation across the finish line.

Our work is not done yet.

KOSA must be signed into law.

2024-07-30T17:05:38.000Z
For far too long, Big Tech has gone unchecked, and we’ve seen the negative effects of social media on our children.

With 91 Senators voting in favor and overwhelming support from parents, stakeholders &amp; over 240 organizations, we know that KOSA is needed now more than ever.

2024-07-30T17:05:37.000Z

While Border Czar Kamala Harris was tasked with addressing the root causes of illegal immigration, a record number of Chinese nationals have crossed the southern border into the United States.

Today, there was an assassination attempt against President Trump.

So much for that “rock solid, unwavering support” for Israel, @POTUS.

Biden is trying to convince Americans his border policy is a “success.”

In less than four years we’ve had:

— Over 10 million illegal border crossings
— Nearly 400 terrorist apprehensions
— Over 460,000 migrants flown to the U.S.
— At least 85,000 missing migrant children

2024-07-12T16:33:10.000Z
Joe Biden said border encounters today are lower than they were under President Trump.

This is blatantly false.

Stop lying to the American people, @POTUS.

FLASHBACK — just months ago, FBI Director Wray said he sees “blinking red lights everywhere” when talking about the potential for a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

Since then, at least 8 suspected terrorists with ties to ISIS have been found inside our nation.

How many more terrorists is he going to allow to invade our nation before he finally secures the border?

Biden’s open border has allowed hundreds of suspected terrorists to infiltrate our nation.
