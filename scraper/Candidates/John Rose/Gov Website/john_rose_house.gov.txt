The REAL ID effort was enacted by Congress in 2005 as a standard set forth in the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations. Since then, it has been a coordinated effort between the Federal Government and all 50 states, specifically the Department of Homeland Security (link is external) and affiliated agencies in each state. The purpose is to deter or inhibit a terrorist’s ability to utilize fraudulent identification and proceed under the radar, specifically when it comes to boarding commercial aircraft and accessing federal facilities and/or nuclear power plants.
REAL ID has been implemented in phases, with the final phase set to begin on October 1, 2020. This final phase will require ticket-holders to present a REAL ID when boarding commercial flights.
Each state has worked to coordinate their individual implementation process, as well as informing their citizens. In Tennessee, the effort is led by the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security (link is external) .
I hope the following information is helpful to you in making decisions for you and your family.
Required Documents for Application:
Each document must be an original or certified. If you have had any name changes, documentation will be required for verification. Please note, all requirements (link is external) pertain to Tennessee license and ID holders seeking a REAL ID, as well as new Tennessee residents with a REAL ID issued in another state.
Applying for a REAL ID:
In addition to Tennessee’s 44 full-service driver services centers and the Downtown Nashville Express Center, a limited list of county clerks (two in our district) are issuing REAL IDs to current Tennessee driver license and ID holders. Additional County Clerk partners will begin issuing REAL ID in the coming months.

Issues
WASHINGTON, DC— U.S. Representative John Rose (R-TN), a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, eighth generation farmer, and former Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture reintroduced H.R. 2462 (link is external) , the Black Vulture Relief Act . The bipartisan legislation is being co-led by Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL), who serves on the Committee on Natural Resources.
The legislation will allow livestock producers and their employees to take black vultures without a permit if they believe the vulture will cause death or injury to their livestock. It is currently illegal to take black vultures without a sub-permit from the authorizing state agency, encasing the issue in bureaucratic red tape and limiting producers’ ability to combat these predators.
Rep. Rose released the following statement:
“ I am proud to reintroduce this important bill. Black vultures are a nuisance to livestock farmers and ranchers, and they pose a deadly threat to young calves and other animals ,” Rep. Rose said . “ I’ve heard from many Tennessee farmers who say the permitting process is too cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly. This bill is a commonsense measure .”
Rep. Soto released this statement:
“ Our farmers and ranchers are facing many obstacles as they work to care for their livestock ,” Rep. Soto said . “ By allowing them to take black vultures without a permit before they harm their livestock, we are improving the likelihood of their success .”
Background:
In 1916, the United States and Canada entered into a treaty aimed at protecting birds that migrate between the two countries, which led to the enactment of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 to implement the treaty in the U.S. The law makes it illegal to take nearly 1,100 species of migratory birds, including black vultures, without a permit.
The bill is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, American Sheep Industry Association, Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation, Tennessee Cattlemen’s Association, Florida Farm Bureau Federation, and Florida Cattlemen’s Association .
Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation President Eric Mayberry:
" We appreciate Congressman Rose's efforts to help cattle producers more effectively protect their herds and, ultimately, their livelihoods. This legislation takes a crucial step in alleviating the burden farmers face with growing black vulture populations and depredation of livestock across Tennessee ."
President Gary Dering, President of the Tennessee Cattlemen’s Association:
" Black Vultures continue to attack newborn livestock, causing significant losses for Tennessee livestock producers. We appreciate Congressman Rose's efforts to address the issue on behalf of cattle producers across the country ."
Steve Clements, American Sheep Industry Association Board Member and South Dakota sheep producer:
“ ASI encourages support for this legislation as vultures are a growing predator of lambs in America, and farmers and ranchers have few options today to address these losses. Predator losses of sheep and the associated management costs are the second-largest expense of many sheep operations in America .”
American Farm Bureau Federation Vice President of Public Policy Sam Kieffer:
“ America’s farmers and ranchers know all too well the impact black vultures can have on livestock, particularly when they attack young or vulnerable animals. Farmers and ranchers take seriously their responsibility to keep their livestock safe, and additionally, this is a financial burden for our members. The Black Vulture Relief Act will help farmers and ranchers protect their animals while responsibly managing migratory birds, including black vultures. We’re grateful to Rep. Rose for his commitment to addressing this challenge .”
National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) Director of Government Affairs Garrett Edmonds:
“ Cattle producers across the South and Midwest face the emotional and financial strain of livestock deaths due to overabundant black vultures. At a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at the lowest number since 1951, producers cannot afford to have vultures killing newborn calves. My family’s cattle operation faces the burden of black vultures daily, with them roosting on nearby service towers overlooking surrounding pastures.
Being in the middle of Spring calving season back home, these predators target the newborns – the weakest animals who cannot defend themselves. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act has been overwhelmingly successful but makes it extremely difficult for producers to properly protect their cattle herds from these predators. It is time to recognize that success and give producers more flexibility in managing black vulture populations. NCBA appreciates Congressmen Rose and Soto for introducing this commonsense bill to properly manage an exploding population of predators .”
Florida Farm Bureau Federation President Jeb S. Smith released this statement:
“ The Florida Farm Bureau Federation strongly supports the reintroduction of the Black Vulture Relief Act, which provides much-needed relief for livestock producers struggling with black vulture predation. Florida’s farmers and ranchers are committed to responsible stewardship of our natural resources, but the increasing black vulture population has caused significant economic losses, particularly for cattle producers.
Under current regulations, the federal permitting process is slow and burdensome, often leaving livestock owners without timely options to protect their animals. This legislation takes a common-sense approach by allowing producers to take necessary action to prevent livestock losses while maintaining proper reporting and oversight.
Florida Farm Bureau appreciates the leadership of both Congressman John Rose of Tennessee and Florida's own Congressman Darren Soto, working to address this issue and urges swift passage of this bill to ensure our farmers and ranchers have the tools they need to protect their livelihoods .”

Additional Background:
According to a report compiled by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, black vulture populations have been increasing in the U.S. from 1996 to 2015 by an average of 4.77% per year. Although they are native to the eastern and southeastern portions of the U.S., they have been expanding their range northward and westward over the past several decades. Black vultures are not only scavengers but will sometimes devour live prey, including newborn calves, lambs, goat kids, and piglets. They will also attack/injure female adults during or after birth, when they are more vulnerable to attacks, to the point where farmers are left with no other choice than euthanasia.

Florida Farm Bureau Federation President Jeb S. Smith released this statement:
“ The Florida Farm Bureau Federation strongly supports the reintroduction of the Black Vulture Relief Act, which provides much-needed relief for livestock producers struggling with black vulture predation. Florida’s farmers and ranchers are committed to responsible stewardship of our natural resources, but the increasing black vulture population has caused significant economic losses, particularly for cattle producers.
Under current regulations, the federal permitting process is slow and burdensome, often leaving livestock owners without timely options to protect their animals. This legislation takes a common-sense approach by allowing producers to take necessary action to prevent livestock losses while maintaining proper reporting and oversight.
Florida Farm Bureau appreciates the leadership of both Congressman John Rose of Tennessee and Florida's own Congressman Darren Soto, working to address this issue and urges swift passage of this bill to ensure our farmers and ranchers have the tools they need to protect their livelihoods .”

Additional Background:
According to a report compiled by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, black vulture populations have been increasing in the U.S. from 1996 to 2015 by an average of 4.77% per year. Although they are native to the eastern and southeastern portions of the U.S., they have been expanding their range northward and westward over the past several decades. Black vultures are not only scavengers but will sometimes devour live prey, including newborn calves, lambs, goat kids, and piglets. They will also attack/injure female adults during or after birth, when they are more vulnerable to attacks, to the point where farmers are left with no other choice than euthanasia.

Rep. Rose Reintroduces Black Vulture Bill to Provide Regulatory Relief to Farmers
April 4, 2025 Press Release WASHINGTON, DC— U.S. Representative John Rose (R-TN), a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, eighth generation farmer, and former Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture reintroduced H.R. 2462 (link is external) , the Black Vulture Relief Act . The bipartisan legislation is being co-led by Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL), who serves on the Committee on Natural Resources. The legislation will allow livestock producers and their employees to take black vultures without a permit if they believe the vulture will cause death or injury to their livestock. It is currently illegal to take black vultures without a sub-permit from the authorizing state agency, encasing the issue in bureaucratic red tape and limiting producers’ ability to combat these predators. Rep. Rose released the following statement: “ I am proud to reintroduce this important bill. Black vultures are a nuisance to livestock farmers and ranchers, and they pose a deadly threat to young calves and other animals ,” Rep. Rose said . “ I’ve heard from many Tennessee farmers who say the permitting process is too cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly. This bill is a commonsense measure .” Rep. Soto released this statement: “ Our farmers and ranchers are facing many obstacles as they work to care for their livestock ,” Rep. Soto said . “ By allowing them to take black vultures without a permit before they harm their livestock, we are improving the likelihood of their success .” Background: In 1916, the United States and Canada entered into a treaty aimed at protecting birds that migrate between the two countries, which led to the enactment of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 to implement the treaty in the U.S. The law makes it illegal to take nearly 1,100 species of migratory birds, including black vultures, without a permit. The bill is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, American Sheep Industry Association, Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation, Tennessee Cattlemen’s Association, Florida Farm Bureau Federation, and Florida Cattlemen’s Association . Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation President Eric Mayberry: " We appreciate Congressman Rose's efforts to help cattle producers more effectively protect their herds and, ultimately, their livelihoods. This legislation takes a crucial step in alleviating the burden farmers face with growing black vulture populations and depredation of livestock across Tennessee ." President Gary Dering, President of the Tennessee Cattlemen’s Association: " Black Vultures continue to attack newborn livestock, causing significant losses for Tennessee livestock producers. We appreciate Congressman Rose's efforts to address the issue on behalf of cattle producers across the country ." Steve Clements, American Sheep Industry Association Board Member and South Dakota sheep producer: “ ASI encourages support for this legislation as vultures are a growing predator of lambs in America, and farmers and ranchers have few options today to address these losses. Predator losses of sheep and the associated management costs are the second-largest expense of many sheep operations in America .” American Farm Bureau Federation Vice President of Public Policy Sam Kieffer: “ America’s farmers and ranchers know all too well the impact black vultures can have on livestock, particularly when they attack young or vulnerable animals. Farmers and ranchers take seriously their responsibility to keep their livestock safe, and additionally, this is a financial burden for our members. The Black Vulture Relief Act will help farmers and ranchers protect their animals while responsibly managing migratory birds, including black vultures. We’re grateful to Rep. Rose for his commitment to addressing this challenge .” National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) Director of Government Affairs Garrett Edmonds: “ Cattle producers across the South and Midwest face the emotional and financial strain of livestock deaths due to overabundant black vultures. At a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at the lowest number since 1951, producers cannot afford to have vultures killing newborn calves.
