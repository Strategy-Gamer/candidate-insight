Kari Lake needs border drama.

Arizonans need border solutions.

I know what it's like to beat the odds. I'm running for Senate to fight for every Arizonan who’s ever felt counted out.

I’m working for bipartisan, common sense border solutions. Because that’s what Arizona really needs. https://t.co/DtUGa4tZjQ

23 years later, we honor the lives lost, the survivors, and the heroes who ran into danger to save others. Their bravery in the face of terror continues to be a lasting symbol of our nation's strength. https://t.co/mBEz6AGAIq

Like me, Gladys understands what it’s like to return home after serving our country. 

I’ll continue the fight to make sure Arizona veterans like her receive the support and resources they need.

The only thing that separated us from a violent mob of insurrectionists, fueled by Kari Lake's misinformation, was some furniture and a few officers.

Kari Lake appeared in a promotional video for Project 2025, which would cut Social Security benefits for the average Arizonan up to $100,000 over 10 years.

Arizona, exactly one month till ballots drop. If you needed a sign to get involved THIS IS IT!

Abortion rights. Protecting Medicare. Bringing down costs. It’s all on the line.

Arizonans are tired of the political stunts and do-nothing-politicians.

It’s time to send a combat Marine to the Senate to get stuff done.

John is a republican, veteran, and small business owner. When he hires someone he looks for the most qualified candidate.

I’m a dad and I’m running for Senate to give my kids (and yours!) the best future possible. 

That means a world where our daughters have abortion rights, affordable housing, and an economy that works for them (and their parents too!)

It’s simple: I’ll protect abortion rights.
Kari Lake will take them away.

That's the choice in this election.

The fight for freedom cannot be won in isolation. 

I’ll always fight to protect Arizonans, our interests, and our allies abroad.

Growing up poor, the child tax credit would have been a lifeline for my mom, who raised four kids on a secretary’s pay.

That’s why I’ll never stop fighting for Arizona’s hardworking families.

2024-05-06T19:55:11.000Z
As a father, I was sickened by the AZ Supreme Court’s ruling.
I won’t sit by and watch my daughter grow up with less rights than her mother and grandmother.

To the teachers who helped me get to Harvard.
