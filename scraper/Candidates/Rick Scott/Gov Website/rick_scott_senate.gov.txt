WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Ted Cruz and colleagues to introduce the Limiting Immunity for Assisting Backers of Lethal Extremism (LIABLE) Act which targets legal loopholes that protect international organizations aiding terrorist groups from being held accountable in a U.S. court of law. The bill would allow American victims of terrorism to sue international organizations that provide support to designated terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, stripping them of immunity currently granted under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA) , and ensuring accountability for those who back terrorism.
Senator Rick Scott said, “For years, UNRWA has been aiding Iran-backed Hamas in their spread of hateful antisemitism. UNRWA has supported Hamas in enabling these terrorists to commit the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping of Israelis and Jewish Americans over 550 days ago, on October 7th, and the sick individuals responsible for this terrorism must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. I’m proud to join my colleague, Senator Ted Cruz, to introduce the LIABLE Act and ensure the victims and their families can finally bring UNRWA to justice.”
Senator Ted Cruz said, “The United Nations Relief and Works Agency officials have for decades knowingly provided support to Hamas terrorists, including salaries and materials. That support facilitated Hamas’s terrorist attack on October 7th, which was the worst one-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and included the murder and kidnapping of dozens of Americans. Those victims and their families deserve the ability to hold UNRWA accountable, and the LIABLE Act would give them that opportunity.”
Senator Kevin Cramer said, “International organizations who knowingly support foreign terrorist organizations should be held legally responsible for their complicity in terrorism. The LIABLE Act ensures those who provide material support to terrorism—whether through direct involvement or by aiding and abetting—can no longer hide behind legal immunity.”
Senator Ted Budd said, “I’m proud to stand with Senator Cruz and my colleagues to introduce the LIABLE Act , which would ensure that victims of terrorism, along with their families, can seek justice and hold international organizations accountable for aiding and abetting terrorist acts. There is no better example of this than UNRWA, an organization with longstanding ties to Hamas, whose staff members participated in the horrific October 7th attacks. America must send a clear message: supporting terrorism will never be tolerated or ignored.”
Senator Pete Ricketts said, “UNRWA employees provided material support for Hamas terrorists and contributed to the barbaric October 7th attacks. They need to be held accountable for aiding and abetting terrorism. This bill will enable American victims of terrorism to get justice.”
Senator Bill Hagerty said, “UNRWA has provided material support to the terrorist organization Hamas and has cultivated anti-Israel extremism and terrorism. UNRWA employees directly participated in the terrorist attacks of October 7th that killed dozens of Americans and UNRWA schools produced over 100 graduates who participated in the atrocities of that terrible day. I am proud to cosponsor this necessary legislation that makes it possible to hold UNRWA accountable for its complicity in terrorism.”
Senator John Barrasso said, “Any international organization aiding terrorist groups must be investigated and held accountable. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency has a lot to answer for after providing resources to Hamas terrorists. The blood of innocent Americans and Israelis who were kidnapped or killed on October 7 is on their hands. I am proud to join Senator Cruz and my colleagues on this important legislation to give victims and their families an opportunity for much-deserved justice.”
Senator Eric Schmitt said, “International organization like UNWRA are deeply tied with Hamas and must be held accountable for playing a role in kidnapping, murdering, and maiming countless innocent lives on October 7th. I am proud to stand with Senator Cruz as a cosponsor of the LIABLE Act to hold these organizations accountable.”

TAMPA, Fla. – Today, Senator Rick Scott stood with members of the Venezuelan community to send a clear message: America stands firmly with the people of Venezuela and against the illegitimate, criminal regime of Nicolás Maduro. Senator Scott also highlighted the decisive actions of President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to hold the Maduro regime accountable and protect America’s national security. Since being in the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has been a leading voice in supporting the Venezuelan people, introducing critical legislation like his BOLIVAR Act and STOP MADURO Act to cut off support for the dictatorship and push for a free, democratic future for Venezuela.
Senator Rick Scott said , “I’m proud to stand with the brave people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom and democracy, alongside Venezuelan community leaders here in Florida and together with rightful Venezuelan President Edmundo González and democracy leader María Corina Machado. The illegitimate Maduro regime has desperately held onto power for too long, depriving the Venezuelan people of their rights and freedoms, only emboldened by the weak Biden administration. I’m glad to see President Trump and Secretary Rubio are taking necessary action to hold Maduro’s regime accountable by cutting off oil licenses to prevent the funding of Maduro’s oppression, and by designating dangerous cartels like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations, which is a crucial step in protecting America’s national security. We must keep taking action to hold the regime accountable, including passing my STOP MADURO Act and BOLIVAR Act to further isolate Maduro and cut off funds to the regime, and by designating two additional Maduro regime-controlled cartels, Cartel de los Soles and DGCIM, as terrorist organizations to protect America’s national security. The days of the Maduro regime exploiting America under the previous administration’s weak appeasement policies are over. Together, we can strip Maduro of every last resource he is using to grip onto power and finally bring a new day of freedom to Venezuela.”

Together, we can strip Maduro of every last resource he is using to grip onto power and finally bring a new day of freedom to Venezuela.”

Sen. Rick Scott Joined Venezuelan Community Leaders to Rally in Support of Freedom and Democracy for Venezuela in Tampa April 24, 2025 TAMPA, Fla. – Today, Senator Rick Scott stood with members of the Venezuelan community to send a clear message: America stands firmly with the people of Venezuela and against the illegitimate, criminal regime of Nicolás Maduro. Senator Scott also highlighted the decisive actions of President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to hold the Maduro regime accountable and protect America’s national security. Since being in the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has been a leading voice in supporting the Venezuelan people, introducing critical legislation like his BOLIVAR Act and STOP MADURO Act to cut off support for the dictatorship and push for a free, democratic future for Venezuela. Senator Rick Scott said , “I’m proud to stand with the brave people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom and democracy, alongside Venezuelan community leaders here in Florida and together with rightful Venezuelan President Edmundo González and democracy leader María Corina Machado. The illegitimate Maduro regime has desperately held onto power for too long, depriving the Venezuelan people of their rights and freedoms, only emboldened by the weak Biden administration. I’m glad to see President Trump and Secretary Rubio are taking necessary action to hold Maduro’s regime accountable by cutting off oil licenses to prevent the funding of Maduro’s oppression, and by designating dangerous cartels like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations, which is a crucial step in protecting America’s national security. We must keep taking action to hold the regime accountable, including passing my STOP MADURO Act and BOLIVAR Act to further isolate Maduro and cut off funds to the regime, and by designating two additional Maduro regime-controlled cartels, Cartel de los Soles and DGCIM, as terrorist organizations to protect America’s national security. The days of the Maduro regime exploiting America under the previous administration’s weak appeasement policies are over. Together, we can strip Maduro of every last resource he is using to grip onto power and finally bring a new day of freedom to Venezuela.” ### https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2025/4/sen-rick-scott-joined-venezuelan-community-leaders-to-rally-in-support-of-freedom-and-democracy-for-venezuela-in-tampa
