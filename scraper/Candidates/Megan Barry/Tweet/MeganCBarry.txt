Green‚Äôs trade ended up being very profitable.

But the problem is that even if members of Congress aren‚Äôt actually using nonpublic information to make trades, there‚Äôs a perception problem. 

It erodes public trust in our government.

2024-10-04T15:19:27.000Z
On March 30th, between the stock purchase and the disclosure, Green voted in favor of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, a bill that sped up permits for energy projects including pipelines.

How did he manage to outperform the market so dramatically? ü§î

Let‚Äôs look at just one trade from last year. Green bought up to $250,000 in an energy company‚Äôs stock on March 24th, and submitted that trade disclosure on April 1st.

Disclosure form: https://t.co/E07ksjZyLO

2024-10-04T15:19:24.000Z
Independent watchdogs calculate that Green‚Äôs stock trading returned an estimated 122% in 2023. To put that in perspective, the S&amp;P 500 returned just 24%.

He achieved the 2nd-most profitable returns out of all 535 members of Congress.

2024-09-24T14:16:34.000Z
The overdose crisis isn't just a border issue, and it‚Äôs certainly not a partisan one. It‚Äôs about priorities.

It‚Äôs time we put politics aside and start saving lives.

If you're with me, join my campaign: https://t.co/sCDFbWHyJV

2024-09-24T14:16:34.000Z
If I can use my platform in Congress to speak about this crisis - to let people know that help is available and that they‚Äôre not alone, and to educate the public that substance use disorder is a disease rather than a moral failing - we can save lives before we pass a single bill.

2024-09-24T14:16:33.000Z
One of the most important things I can do in Congress to address the overdose crisis, though, is to speak about it. To use my voice to destigmatize substance use disorder.

The shame of this disease is often what prevents people from seeking treatment.

2024-09-24T14:16:33.000Z
We must also invest in social determinants of health, like affordable housing, mental health care, and workforce training. 

Substance use disorder is often driven by poverty and unemployment. To reduce addiction, we must address these root causes.

2024-09-24T14:16:32.000Z
Every one of these bills enjoys bipartisan co-sponsorship.

Not one of them is co-sponsored by Mark Green.

2024-09-24T14:16:31.000Z
The Save America's Rural Hospitals Act supports critical-access hospitals.

The Rural America Health Corps Act provides loan repayment for healthcare workers serving in rural areas.

The Protecting Rural Telehealth Access Act expands remote healthcare coverage.

2024-09-24T14:16:31.000Z
The overdose crisis has hit rural Tennessee hard, especially b/c of their lack of access to care.

TN's rural hospitals have closed at an alarming rate since our legislature (incl. then-State Sen. Mark Green) refused to expand Medicaid.

But there are proposals to address this:

2024-09-24T14:16:30.000Z
I will support the Mental Health Justice Act (156 bipartisan cosponsors, no Mark Green), which would help direct funds to mental health services and ensure that those suffering from mental health crises are treated with the appropriate resources.
https://t.co/qfY6no3gev

2024-09-24T14:16:30.000Z
I‚Äôll fight to remove barriers to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT).

We've seen how effective it can be‚Äîespecially when combined with other treatments. It‚Äôs time to make this lifesaving care more accessible to every community that needs it.
https://t.co/uHlAPNUT5h

2024-09-24T14:16:29.000Z
Another important step is funding overdose prevention centers. 

These centers offer a safe environment for people to use pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision. They reduce overdose deaths and connect people to treatment‚Äîproven life-savers in cities like New York.

2024-09-24T14:16:28.000Z
I will push for federal funding to expand the distribution of Naloxone (Narcan), which can reverse overdoses. 

While it's available over the counter now, the high costs are still a barrier for many. This life-saving treatment needs to be free and widely accessible.

2024-09-24T14:16:28.000Z
I will support the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, which would allow patients to receive medications like methadone at pharmacies rather than just treatment centers, improving access to care, especially in rural areas like parts of TN-7.
https://t.co/i7Tx3oNoY5

2024-09-24T14:16:27.000Z
But Congress has still done precious little to address this crisis.

There are a number of bills proposed, most of which enjoy bipartisan support, that remain stuck in legislative limbo.

In Congress, I will not only support them, but push leadership to bring them to a vote.

2024-09-24T14:16:26.000Z
In 2017, when Max died, over 107,000 Americans died from overdoses.

In 2022, it was over 111,000.

Nashville ranks 2nd in the nation for overdose deaths per capita among cities, and TN ranks 2nd among states.

Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-45.

2024-09-24T14:16:26.000Z
Today, my first TV spot goes live, sharing the story of our son Max and the loss of his life to an overdose. It's a story too many families can relate to. In Congress, I‚Äôll fight to end this epidemic.

"Rather than fixing our roads?"

The Biden-Harris admin brought $6.6 billion to TN through the BIL with $3.9 billion for roads and bridges alone. You voted against it.

Instead of spreading misinformation, maybe try supporting bills that actually help Tennesseans. https://t.co/eGSCC2Ycl0

This was a partisan outcome.

Judges aren't experts on all issues, and this decision will force them to define complex matters like "clean water" or "safe and effective" drugs in lawsuits in the future.

We know where Mark Green stands. He's voted against protecting access to birth control, and against codifying Roe v. Wade.

But remember, they told us Roe wasn't under attack, too - right up until the day it was overturned.

Now, she and Senate Rs have voted against the Right to Contraception Act, calling it unnecessary because the use of birth control is already protected under Supreme Court precedent.

Support for cannabis legalization is strong, with 60% of voters in favor of legalizing it for recreational use.

2024-05-22T18:19:51.000Z
Gun safety is another critical issue.

76% of voters - and 64% of MAGA Republicans! - support laws that temporarily restrict access to guns for individuals at high risk of harming themselves or others.

Majorities also support safe storage and universal background checks. (5/9)

2024-05-22T18:19:51.000Z
Healthcare access remains a top concern.

A large majority of Tennesseans support expanding Medicaid, which our state has refused to do (and which Mark Green refused to vote for in the State Senate.)

We've missed out on $22 billion and counting. Ridiculous. (4/9)

2024-05-22T18:19:50.000Z
Reproductive freedom is first.

A majority of Tennesseans consider themselves pro-choice, yet we have some of the strictest abortion laws in the country.

Tennessee has seen a 20% drop in obstetric residency program applicants. Why?

Because here, performing an abortion is a felony ‚Äî punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

More than 30% of TN counties have ZERO obstetric care, including 5 counties in #TN7

Our rural hospitals have shut their doors because Green wouldn‚Äôt support Medicaid Expansion. 

Our overdose rate is skyrocketing and Green is silent. 

Children are being gunned down in our schools and Green does nothing.

He‚Äôs in Congress to represent #TN7 and does *nothing*

So honored to be on the rooftop to celebrate Berdelle Campbell, a true Nashville treasure, and to celebrate with all of the fabulous folks from @The_Compact.

The night was beautiful and we could see the mighty Cumberland rolling by - a fitting tribute to the work Berdelle has https://t.co/i0188guFpf

64 years ago today, the FDA approved the first birth control pill in the U.S.

Mark Green is a doctor, so he knows how dangerous it is to deny women access to birth control - but he's bragged about refusing to prescribe it.

I will always fight for your reproductive freedom. https://t.co/2qIEvLMVJn

On #NationalNursesDay we recognize how much nurses mean to us, especially in rural areas where hospital closures hit hard.

Losing hospitals means losing access to care - and jobs - for thousands.

Nurses are on the front lines fighting for us. Let's fight for them, too. üá∫üá∏üè•üíô https://t.co/DJ899ihqNB
