MEGAN BARRY is the former mayor of Nashville, TN, the first woman to be elected to the office. While she was in office, she lost her only son, Max, to a drug overdose. Since leaving her position, Barry is working to combat the shame and guilt that comes from this soul-sucking disease and to help those who struggle with substance use disorder and their loved ones by speaking up and speaking out. Born in California and raised in Kansas, Barry has a BS from Baker University and an MBA from Vanderbilt University. She’s worked as a corporate executive, an independent consultant focusing on business ethics and corporate responsibility, and an adjunct professor. She is currently running for US Congress. Barry has served on several boards and has been an invited speaker for numerous organizations and events. She is married to Bruce Barry, and they share their home with two rescue pups, Winslow and Natasha.
An honest, heartbreaking and heartfelt account of a true life story and a compelling read with an uplifting message of triumph over tragedy and a fall from grace lived out in the public eye. A true redemption story. Thank you, Megan, for your honest account. Gives us all hope for our own fall and rise moments.
This book is heartbreakingly beautiful and funny and HUMAN. I don’t know that there’s ever been a more honest account from a political leader. Barry doesn’t hold back on any of it— winning, losing, REAL loss, and coming back. This was an especially poignant read post election. Loved it!
I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys memoirs or is curious about Megan Barry’s life and political career or just enjoys a good story of resilience. The audiobook production was excellent, and I loved Barry’s narration. It was so powerful to hear her tell her story in her own distinctive voice. She knows how to tell a compelling story, so I particularly recommend the audiobook.

It's What You Do Next: The Fall and Rise of Nashville's First Female Mayor
Get the Latest from megan
USA Today Bestseller - Available now!
At some point, all of us will be at our worst, and while some of us will be remembered for it, none of us should be defined by it. In 2015, after a historic run-off election, Megan Barry made history as Nashville's first female mayor, quickly becoming a beloved leader with a forward-thinking vision for a modern South. For her first few years in office, she was one of the most important voices at the table. Until she became the most notorious.
It’s What You Do Next is a deeply honest book about womanhood at home, in politics, and in the spaces between. It’s about moving forward after we’ve fallen short, finding the grace to love, and to love oneself again. It’s about the aching world of grief and the light beyond it. Warm, funny, and uncompromisingly honest, Barry speaks to women as their close friend, not their fearless leader, her true self, not always her best self. She gives readers permission to come as they are and leave knowing that what matters most, is what happens next.
