How Can We Help You?
One of Senator Rosen’s most important responsibilities as a United States Senator is assisting Nevada residents with navigating federal agencies and identifying federal resources. Senator Rosen can help individuals seeking assistance from the federal government on a variety of matters, including veterans’ benefits, Social Security, and citizenship.
If you have a time-sensitive matter please contact my office for immediate assistance.
Before we can be of assistance, the Privacy Act requires that first you submit a written authorization. Should you have any questions about the Privacy Release Forms, do not hesitate to contact my office .
In order to open a case with our office, click to complete a digital privacy release form, which can be accessed in English or Spanish .
If you would rather complete a paper copy, please complete the following steps:

Let Senator Rosen’s staff assist you in planning your trip to Washington, DC. Please fill out the form below, fields marked with an (*) are required.
Senator Rosen offers internships for college students, recent college graduates, and others looking to experience life on Capitol Hill. The purpose of the program is to give interns firsthand knowledge of the way in which a Senate office operates on a daily basis, to observe the legislative process at the federal level and to develop research skills related to public policy.
The basic internships program consists of four components:
The Senate Page Program offers Nevada students a unique experience of the Legislative branch in action. Pages have the opportunity to meet some of the nation’s most prominent leaders and witness firsthand political debates in the United States Senate, a place often referred to as the “greatest deliberative body in the world.”
A Page’s duties consist primarily of delivery of correspondence and legislative material within the Congressional complex.  Other duties include preparing the chamber for Senate sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to the desk. Pages are expected to work from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. or until the Senate adjourns for the day.
There are four established page sessions.  The academic year consists of two semesters that run from early September through mid-January, and from mid-January through mid-June.  The summer program consists of two sessions that are usually three or four weeks in duration depending on the legislative calendar.
Each session, only 30 positions are available for the 100 Senators. Interest in the Page Program is high, and because not every Senator is able to sponsor a page, the application process is highly competitive.
Of the 30 positions that are available, 15 are for male pages and 15 are for female pages. Senator Rosen’s page sponsorship alternates by gender. Feel free to contact our Washington, DC office directly by emailing page@rosen.senate.gov or by calling 202-224-6244 to confirm whether we have requested a male or female candidate spot in the upcoming session.
Pages are responsible for their own travel to and from Washington, DC.
Click HERE for more information and history about the U.S. Senate Page Program.
There are four sessions of the Senate Page Program. The Fall session runs from early September through mid-January. The spring session runs from mid-January through mid-June. The summer includes two sessions which run three to four weeks long. Summer Session I begins in early June, and Summer Session II begins in early July.
During the fall and spring sessions, Pages are required to live in the Daniel Webster Senate Page Residence, located two blocks from the Hart Senate Office Building. The cost of living in Daniel Webster Hall is $780 per month, plus a refundable $250 security deposit. Breakfast and dinner are provided for the Pages. The cost of rent and food is automatically deducted from the Page’s salary, which is paid on the basis of an annual salary of $25,605. Staff in Webster Hall includes a Program Director, Administrative Aide and four proctors, the latter of which reside in Webster Hall. United States Capitol Police maintain a 24-hour security desk and a provision that requires all individuals to present identification and all visitors to sign in.
During the summer sessions, pages can request arrangements for alternate housing.
The Senate Page School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. During the academic sessions, Pages attend class in the Page dormitory at Webster Hall. A Page’s academic day begins at 6:15 a.m. and classes extend until 9:45 a.m. or one hour before the Senate convenes. The curriculum consists of English, mathematics, science and social studies. The Page School also offers a Field Studies program to ensure that Pages are exposed to many of the educational and cultural activities that Washington, D.C. offers.
Before completing your application, please communicate with your base school to determine how Page School academic credits will transfer if you are offered a page position.
Each session, only 30 positions are available for the 100 Senators. Interest in the Page Program is high, and because not every Senator is able to sponsor a page, the application process is highly competitive.
Of the 30 positions that are available, 15 are for male pages and 15 are for female pages. Senator Rosen’s page sponsorship alternates by gender. Feel free to contact our office directly to confirm whether we have requested a male or female candidate spot in the upcoming session.
Interested applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible so that we can process your application in a timely manner.
Senate Pages must be sponsored by a Senator. Pages sponsored by Senator Rosen must be residents of Nevada.
Pages must be citizens of the United States or subject to agreements of the Department of State, and must have a Social Security number.
Page eligibility is limited to juniors in high school who will be 16 or 17 on or before the date of appointment.
Pages must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a home school transcript and a certification of immunization to qualify for attendance at the school.
A general health assessment completed by a licensed physician is required, in addition to certification of immunization. Pages play an important role in the day-to-day operation of the Senate. Their schedule can be long and tedious, and requires tremendous endurance; good health and stamina are requirements which cannot be waived.
Pages are also required to be covered by health insurance; if not covered, they will be required to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
Please read these instructions carefully before proceeding with the application.
In order to process your application, we’ll need contact information for your parents or guardians, your semester availability and the name, address and phone number for your current high school. We’ll also need to know your cumulative GPA to make sure you qualify for the Page school. The Page school currently requires a 3.0 cumulative GPA at a minimum. You can also list any school, community or work activites that may set you apart from other students applying to be a U.S. Senate Page.
Once you have completed the questionnaire portion of the application, please make sure you hit Submit on the last page. You will receive a confirmation email from our office. Please make sure your junk mail filter is set to accept emails from our office in order to receive important updates about the application process.
We need several important documents from you. All documents must be submitted in order for us to be able to consider your application. The first document is a letter of intent explaining why you are interested in becoming a United States Page. We’ll also need your full high school transcript. Your school should send the sealed transcript to our office’s address (found below and on the checklist page). Please also submit two letters of recommendation from a mentor, teacher or employer. Recommendation letters from family members will not be accepted.
The letter of intent and recommendation letters can be submitted online by clicking the envelope icon next to each item on the checklist page. You will receive a confirmation email from our office. Please make sure your junk mail filter is set to accept emails from our office in order to receive important updates about the application process.
If at any time you have questions or issues regarding the checklist, questionnaire, or any other part of the application process. Please don’t hesitate to contact us in the Washington, DC office at 202-224-6244.
Pages serve principally as messengers. They carry documents between the House and Senate, Members’ offices, committees, and the Library of Congress. They also prepare the House and Senate chambers for each day’s business by distributing the Congressional Record and other documents related to the day’s agenda and assist in the cloakrooms and chambers. When Congress is in session, they sit near the dais where they may be summoned by Members for assistance.
Pages are expected to work from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m., or whenever the Senate adjourns for the day.

Academy and Nomination Procedures

Guidance and key resources to help eligible grant seekers find information on federal grants, loans, and non-financial assistance, as well as on private funding. Prepared by the Congressional Research Service for the U.S. Senate, updated July 2019.
Assistance Listings at beta.SAM.gov (General Services Administration) Official descriptions of more than 2,200 federal assistance programs (including grants, loans, and other financial and nonfinancial assistance) can be found on SAM.gov . The website, produced by the General Services Administration (GSA), is currently in beta, and it houses federal assistance listings previously found on the now-retired Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). Each federal assistance program has a corresponding CFDA program number; these CFDA numbers are still used as numerical program identifiers. Programs are searchable at the “Assistance Listings” domain at SAM.gov ; descriptions are updated by departments and agencies, and they cover authorizing legislation, objectives, and eligibility and compliance requirements. The site will eventually be renamed SAM.gov . For current notices of funding availability, see Grants.gov or FedConnect .
Grants.gov (via Dept. of Health and Human Services) Federal grants website that allows eligible grantseekers (see Who is eligible for a Grant? ) to find and apply for current competitive grant opportunities from ALL federal agencies. Grantseekers can check on notices of funding availability (NOFAs) posted in the last 7 days; access RSS feeds of grant opportunities; and apply for federal grants through a unified process by downloading the application and submitting online. The website guides grantseekers in obtaining a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number, registering with System for Award Management (SAM), and registering with Grants.gov to apply and to track applications. See also website FedConnect for additional grants and contracts opportunities.
State Single Points of Contact (Office of Management and Budget) Under Executive Order 12372, some states require federal grants applicants to submit a copy of their application for state government level review and comment. The state offices listed here coordinate federal financial assistance and may direct federal development. For help in identifying state-level grants, other state government agencies websites may be found at State and Local Agencies .
A-Z Index of U.S. Department and Agencies (General Services Administration) To better develop a grant proposal, search a department or agency’s Home Page to learn more about its programs and objectives. The site USA.gov also links to Government Benefits, Grants and Loans .
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Funding (Department of Energy) Grants are EERE’s primary funding vehicle for businesses, industries, universities and others. Most EERE grants are awarded on merit on a competitive basis. See also EERE Financial Opportunities and listings on Grants.gov or FedConnect . For state-by-state information on state, local. utility, and federal incentives that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency, search DSIRE (Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency).
DHS Financial Assistance (Department of Homeland Security) Most Homeland Security non-disaster grant programs are designated for state and local governments and specific entities such as colleges, etc. Unsolicited applications from individuals are generally not accepted. Includes Urban Area Security Initiative, Citizens Corps, Medical Response System, Operation Stonegarden (border security), Infrastructure Protection. Contact homeland security State Offices . Programs for firefighters may be found at Assistance to Firefighters .
USA.gov for Businesses and Nonprofits ( GSA ) Includes contracting with the federal government, international trade and exporting, and small business. See also financial assistance links at the Small Business Administration website.
FBO.gov ( GSA ) Official website posting business, contracting, and procurement opportunities with the federal government. Useful information for vendors, including FBO Demonstration Videos and Frequently Asked Questions, appear under the Getting Started tab. Search options include an advanced search form for more targeted filtering of current opportunities.
Student Aid on the Web (Department of Education) Financial assistance for education beyond high school is generally “needs-based” and often includes loans and work-study, in addition to some grants. College and university applications, websites, and brochures usually include financial aid information for prospective and incoming students.
https://www.benefits.gov/ ( via Department of Labor ) Government grants are not direct assistance to individuals, but fund state and local programs providing help to those in need. This online screening site can be used to identify state and local government benefits and how to apply. Covers direct payments, loans, insurance, training, or other services.
FTC Consumer Alert (Federal Trade Commission) The FTC warns consumers to beware of paying “processing fees” for information that is available free to the public. Ads claiming federal grants are available for home repairs, home business, unpaid bills, or other personal expenses are often a scam.
OMB Grants Management Web Site (Office of Management and Budget) OMB establishes government-wide grants management policies and guidelines through circulars and common rules. OMB Circulars are cited in beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listing program descriptions and may be printed out full text.
Foundation Center Grants Space Candid (formerly the Foundation Center) Grants Space Gateway to information about private funding sources, the grantseeking process, guidelines on writing a grant proposal, addresses of state libraries with grants reference collections, and links to other useful Internet websites. The Center maintains a comprehensive Foundation Directory Online database on foundations; produces print and electronic directories and guides; conducts research and publishes studies in the field; and offers a variety of training and educational seminars.

United States Senator Jacky Rosen is committed to working with both parties to deliver for Nevada’s hardworking families. She is fighting for all Nevadans by being an independent voice who brings people together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions for our state.
Senator Jacky Rosen works across the aisle to solve problems and achieve results for Nevada. Elected to the U.S. House in 2016 and then the U.S. Senate in 2018, Jacky is the second woman ever to serve Nevada in the U.S. Senate, alongside fellow Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.
Jacky has been ranked by independent experts as one of the most bipartisan Senators in the chamber . More than 90% of the legislation she has introduced in the Senate is bipartisan, and her commitment to building relationships and working across the aisle has earned her a reputation for making “ Republican friends as a way to get things done. ”
In 2021, Jacky helped write and pass the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as part of the bipartisan group of Senators who negotiated the final landmark package. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is now delivering thousands of good-paying jobs to our state while fixing Nevada’s roads and highways, modernizing our airports, and making high-speed internet faster and more affordable.
In the Senate, Jacky is working to improve the lives of all Nevadans and fighting for an economy that gives everyone the opportunity to succeed. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion, Jacky has led bipartisan efforts to restore Nevada’s tourism and hospitality industry, provide resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs, bolster our state’s booming clean energy economy, break down barriers for legally operating cannabis businesses, and build up Nevada as an incubator of innovative new technologies and cutting-edge research. She is an ally of Nevada’s labor community, believes in the right of workers to join a union, and supports pro-worker policies like affordable child care, paid family leave, and equal pay for equal work. And with rising prices stretching families’ budgets to the breaking point, Jacky is pushing to increase access to affordable housing in Nevada, cut taxes for the middle class, and lower costs for everyday essentials.
When it comes to education, Jacky has passed funding to rebuild Nevada’s crumbling and outdated K-12 public schools, fought for better pay for our teachers, and pushed for increased mental health resources for our students. She has introduced legislation to expand and improve key workforce development programs and skills training initiatives to prepare Nevadans for the careers of the 21st century.
As the only former computer programmer in the U.S. Senate, Jacky has been a champion for strengthening our nation’s cybersecurity and improving science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education, including through her bipartisan Building Blocks of STEM Act, which was signed into law . Jacky is the co-founder and co-chair of the first ever bipartisan Women in STEM Caucus in the Senate.
Jacky knows that health care is the key that makes other opportunities possible. That’s why she is working to bring down the rising cost of health care and prescription drugs, tackle Nevada’s doctor shortage, and increase access to telemedicine and rural health care. As Chair of the Senate’s bipartisan Comprehensive Care Caucus, she is fighting to support family caregivers and will always stand strong to protect Medicare and Social Security for our seniors.
Jacky is laser-focused on putting Nevada first and prioritizing the issues that matter to our unique state. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she is a strong advocate for Nevada’s servicemembers, military families, and defense installations – playing a key role in shaping and passing the annual national defense bill to enhance America’s national security and support our troops. The proud daughter of a World War II veteran, Jacky is standing up for Nevada’s veterans and expanding access to the benefits our nation’s heroes have earned. She is also committed to ensuring Nevada’s local law enforcement and first responders have the resources to do their jobs and keep our communities safe from crime.
A longtime proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, Jacky has pushed Congress to finally tackle this issue by providing a pathway to citizenship, strengthening border security while keeping families together, and repairing this severely broken system. As someone who spent most of her life outside of politics, Jacky is working to bring more accountability to the federal government, taking on political corruption, and reforming how Washington works. Like the vast majority of Nevadans, she is a fierce defender of women’s reproductive health rights, as well as LGBTQ+ rights and voting rights.
As Nevadans know, the effects of climate change have hit our state hard. Jacky has secured critical resources to combat Western drought impacting Lake Mead and Lake Tahoe, and to mitigate the increasing threat of wildfires. She is a staunch defender of keeping Nevada’s public lands in public hands for all to enjoy and increasing conservation efforts to protect our state’s natural beauty. Jacky has been leading the fight against job-killing tariffs on solar energy technology that are hurting domestic projects, raising prices, and stunting our climate goals. She has also stood strong against efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, ensuring Nevada never becomes a dumping ground for the rest of the nation’s nuclear waste.
Growing up in a working class family in the Chicago suburbs, Jacky was the first in her family to graduate from college. To afford higher education and make ends meet, she took out student loans and worked multiple jobs, including waiting tables at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas where she was a proud member of Culinary Workers Union Local 226. Jacky earned her undergraduate bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis in 1979 and later earned her associate’s degree in computing and information technology in 1985 from Clark County Community College, which is now the College of Southern Nevada. After working as a computer programmer at major companies in Southern Nevada, she later stepped away from her career to take care of her aging parents and in-laws as they dealt with increasing health issues.
Before being elected to public office, Jacky served as President of Congregation Ner Tamid, Nevada’s largest synagogue. She holds the distinction of being the third female Jewish Senator in U.S. history, as well as the first former synagogue president to serve in the Senate. An outspoken supporter of Israel and combating antisemitism, she is now the co-founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism and the bipartisan Abraham Accords Caucus in the Senate.
Jacky has called Nevada home for more than 40 years. She and her husband Larry live in Henderson and are the proud parents of their daughter, Miranda.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) announced that bipartisan legislation she co-sponsored to help inform veterans of their eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs and services has been signed into law as part of a comprehensive veterans health care and benefits package. The Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act authorizes $10 million each for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to support County Veterans Service Officers (CVSO) and local efforts to make veterans more aware of their benefits; help them file pension and compensation claims; and assist them with enrolling in job, housing, disability, and education benefits.
“Veterans deserve to take full advantage of all the benefits they have earned through their brave service to our nation,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud that this bipartisan bill has become law to better inform more veterans of the programs and services available to them. I’ll keep working with both parties to give veterans in Nevada the resources they need.”
Senator Rosen has worked consistently to deliver for Nevada’s veterans. Her bipartisan bill to require the VA to maintain a permanent helpline for veterans to use for information on VA services is now law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 . She also successfully pushed President Biden to include the construction of a new VA hospital in Reno in his 2024 Budget Request and helped introduce and pass bipartisan legislation to officially authorize its construction. She also helped pass the PACT Act , a historic law that extended Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and health care to all veterans suffering from illnesses as a result of exposure to burn pits and other toxins during their service.

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, met with Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21), President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations. During their meeting, they discussed a wide array of issues related to maintaining US leadership at the UN, including the need to continue supporting Israel at the United Nations.
“Today, I had the pleasure of meeting with Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to discuss her nomination to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and how she plans to support our allies and stand up to our adversaries in this international body,” said Senator Rosen. “We also discussed the United Nations’ anti-Israel bias, and how she plans to push back on politically-motivated actions against our democratic ally. I look forward to working with her in this role to support American diplomacy around the world and strengthen our national security.”
Senator Rosen has been a strong leader in the push to protect international security, advance American security interests, and support United Nations member states such as Israel and Ukraine. She helped pass critical aid to support Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan and respond to humanitarian crises around the globe. She previously urged the United Nations to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions against them and condemned their inaction in addressing Hamas’s sexual violence against women.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) announced more than $700,000 in federal funding to support transportation services for Tribal communities in Nevada. These funds, which come from the Department of Transportation’s Tribal Transit Program, will be used to support transit services for members of the Walker River Paiute and Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes to improve access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
“By improving transit services and expanding transportation opportunities in Tribal communities in Nevada, we can help families more easily get to work, seek medical care, or pursue educational opportunities,” said Senator Rosen. “This funding will help members of the Walker River Paiute and Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes access vital services that they might otherwise not be able to reach. I will keep fighting to connect all communities in Nevada and improve transportation services across our state.”
As a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Rosen has been an advocate for Nevada’s transportation and infrastructure interests. She worked to write and pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create good-paying jobs and upgrade Nevada’s infrastructure. Last year, she secured $275 million to improve and expand I-80 to reduce congestion in Northern Nevada.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) announced that they helped deliver more than $15.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to improve housing and transportation infrastructure in Las Vegas’ Historic Westside. This investment comes from a grant program established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , which Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto helped pass.
“Access to reliable public transportation is critical for helping hardworking Nevadans,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud to announce that the Historic Westside in Las Vegas is receiving nearly $16 million to improve transportation access. This federal funding will support housing stability, revitalize the Historic Westside, and better connect residents with downtown Las Vegas.”
“The Historic Westside is a hub for the Black community in Las Vegas and is a key piece of our economy and culture,” said Senator Cortez Masto . “I have consistently fought to provide federal opportunities for the Westside, and I was proud to help secure this funding, which will continue to support new affordable housing, help revitalize this historic neighborhood, and draw new business to this beloved Nevada community.”
Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto helped deliver $15,724,050 for the Historic Westside through the USDOT’s Reconnecting Communities Pilot Grant Awards. This transportation project will support the Marble Manor public housing redevelopment and contribute to hundreds of jobs revitalizing the streetscape along two corridors: Washington Avenue and H Street, including widened sidewalks, bike lanes, curb extensions, transit stop improvements, enhanced lighting, and shade trees to provide a range of comfortable and accessible transportation choices for neighborhood residents.
Senator Rosen and Senator Cortez Masto have prioritized securing federal funding for the Historic Westside, including $50 million through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to revitalize and create more middle-class homes at the Marble Manor Apartments, $1.3 million to help redevelop the Jackson Avenue corridor, $6.9 million to support workforce development programs at the Westside Education and Training Center, and $1.7 million to improve broadband access for Westside residents.

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) announced that the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the City of Las Vegas will receive $50 million in grant funding through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to revitalize and create more middle-class homes at the Marble Manor Apartments in the Historic West Side of Las Vegas. SNRHA is one of six grantees nationwide, and these funds will support community investments in Marble Manor and surrounding areas to improve housing and build job training, child care, sports, and community recreation centers, as well as a community garden and a grocery store.
“As southern Nevada continues to grow, I’ve made it a priority to secure federal funding to support responsible development and increase Nevadans’ access to quality, affordable housing,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud to have helped secure millions to help build quality housing and neighborhoods in Las Vegas and will keep pushing to ensure Nevada continues to receive its fair share of federal funding.”
“Lowering housing costs is among Nevadans’ top concerns, and that’s why I’ve been working tirelessly to bring in more resources to Nevada to make housing more affordable,” said Senator Cortez Masto . “These funds I secured will help more Nevada families afford their homes and make their neighborhoods safer. I will continue fighting to ensure more Nevadans have a roof over their heads.”
“Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority (SNRHA) is honored to be selected for this award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fiscal Year 2023/24 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant in partnerships with the city of Las Vegas,” said Lewis Jordan, SNRHA Executive Director . “The value of this additional support cannot be overstated as it helps us to more quickly and efficiently advance of our mission of providing quality housing to those who need it most. And, the residents of Marble Manor will greatly benefit from a comprehensive redevelopment that will significantly enhance their quality of life.”
Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have been leaders in the fight to lower housing costs and support Tribal communities. Senator Rosen recently introduced the Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploitation (HOME) Act to crack down on housing price gouging by corporate investors who are driving up home prices by buying up housing stock. This year, Cortez Masto secured $9.4 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to support nine affordable housing developments across Nevada, including Tribes, and cut through red tape to make it easier to build affordable housing across the state. She is leading legislation to significantly increase the amount of federal funds available for the HOME Investment Partnership Program to build more affordable housing across the country.
