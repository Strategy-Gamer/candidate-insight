Fifteen Congressional colleagues co-signed the letter.
The letter reads:

We call on the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally release them. Their incarceration is a travesty of justice and an affront to the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and all international institutions committed to peace, accountability, and the rule of law.

It is important to provide all children and families access to a quality, affordable education and healthcare to help them secure a prosperous future. As a member of Congress, I have championed for legislation that makes it easier for Americans to balance work and family responsibilities, expands support for foster youth care, and serves the needs of children with special behavioral health needs and/or medical disabilities. I also firmly believe that assisting families in their pursuit of higher education is critical for our nation's growth and success.
Education is a priority for families in the Ninth District. I am honored to represent the district's many schools, enrichment centers, and institutions of higher education. Education has been one of the focal points of my career, and I believe everyone should have access to a quality education.
In February 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading international network of scientists, for the first time concluded that global warming is "unequivocal" and that human activity is the main driver of it, causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950. Specifically, deforestation and an overdependence on fossil fuels have played a large part in the decline of our atmosphere and the loss of numerous natural resources. The Nature Conservancy reports that deforestation is responsible for 20-25 percent of all carbon emissions.
Regardless of personal background or political leanings, we all share a concern for access to health care for ourselves and our families. Congressman Cohen is committed to making quality and comprehensive health care more affordable and more accessible.
The bravery and devotion veterans have shown throughout our history have helped build this great country, and each of us owes them—and their families—a debt of gratitude.
Congressman Cohen believes the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that veterans receive all of the benefits they have earned.
As a lifelong patron of the arts, I have made it a priority to assist the arts community both locally and nationally throughout my legislative career. The arts play a vital role in our community's economic growth and in providing cultural and educational benefits as well. I am pleased to have received an A+ on the Americans for the Arts Action Fund Congressional Scorecard.

One of the main responsibilities of Congress is to determine how taxpayer dollars are distributed throughout the nation. I work hard to make sure that programs that will help the Ninth District receive adequate funding. It is important that we ensure economic security for hard-working American families and small businesses by providing adequate funding for our nation's transportation projects, Social Security and Medicare, and medical research.

Fifteen Congressional colleagues co-signed the letter.
The letter reads:
We strongly condemn the continued detention of three Ukrainian nationals — Vadym Golda, Maxim Petrov, and Dmytro Shabanov — all former OSCE officials who were unjustly arrested and convicted following farce trials by the Russian-controlled “supreme courts” in the occupied territories of Ukraine. We call on the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally release them. Their incarceration is a travesty of justice and an affront to the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and all international institutions committed to peace, accountability, and the rule of law.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) and Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts today led 59 Congressional colleagues in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin requesting a list of companies seeking a Presidential Exemption under the Clean Air Act.

How we treat animals is a direct reflection of our character, both as individuals and a nation. Throughout my legislative career, both as a state Senator and as a Member of Congress, I have sponsored and supported legislation to ensure the humane treatment of animals, as well as to protect our nation's wildlife. I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus and to have had The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife recognize my voting record with a 100% rating.
Ending Horse Soring
Horse "soring" is a cruel practice that some trainers use to ensure that their horses walk with a desired high-stepping gait, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. I sponsored the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act to end this cruel practice.
Protecting Wildlife
I cosponsored the Refuge From Cruel Trapping Act to ban the use of possession of cruel body gripping traps in the Natural Wildlife Refuge System.
Animal Cruelty
As a State Senator in Tennessee, I sponsored legislation to make aggravated animal cruelty a felony, as well as legislation that allow owners to receive damages in cases of intentional or negligent acts resulting in the death of a pet.
I have cosponsored legislation such as the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, which would extend federal jurisdiction to cases involving intentional crushing of animals. Additionally, I cosponsored the Pet and Women Safety Act to prohibit threats of acts of violence against a person's pet under the offenses of stalking and interstate violation of a protection order.
Animal Use in Research
We cannot as a government allow abuse towards animals in research to continue. Our humanity is diminished when we not only allow but actively sanction and financially support such abuse.
To end these abuses, I cosponsored the Animal Welfare in Agricultural Research Endeavors Act, which would close the loophole in the Animal Welfare Act that exempts U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) from adhering to federal animal welfare standards. I also cosponsored the Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training Practices Act, which would require the Department of Defense to conduct research on human-based simulation training methods and replace live tissue training by 2020. Live tissue training is inflicting wounds seen in combat situations on animals for the purposes of surgical training by medical personnel.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) and 16 cosponsors today reintroduced the Prohibit Wildlife Killing Contests Act to stop the practice of rewarding hunters for killing animals on public land in contests that serve no legitimate wildlife-management purpose.
Congressman Cohen made the following statement:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a longtime opponent of the intentional injury to horse legs and feet called soring to create an exaggerated gait at walking horse shows, today applauded the release of U.S.
WASHINGTON – Congressmen Steve Cohen (TN-9), Jerry Nadler (NY-12) and Jared Huffman (CA-2) were joined by eleven other Members of Congress on a letter they sent today to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland requesting that the Department of the Interior (DOI) prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service’s Wildlife Services Program from using body-gripping traps on all DOI lands.
MEMPHIS -- Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09), a longtime member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, has once again received a “100 +” on the Humane Society of the United States 2023 legislative scorecard. The recognition accounts for Congressman Cohen’s actions, including critical votes, advancing the humane treatment of animals.
WASHINGTON — Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus who was awarded the Humane Society’s Humane Horseman of the Year last year, and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-9) and Congressman Vern Buchanan (FL-16), today led 122 Congressional colleagues in a letter to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack urging him to quickly finalize and publish the rule proposed on August 21 to strengthen enforcement of the 1970 Horse Protection Act to crack
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) traveled to Dulles International Airport this morning for the ceremonial send-off for the giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their youngest cub, Xiao Qi Ji. Afterward, he made the following statement:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) and Memphis officials will hold a press availability on Tuesday, October 31, to discuss the $3 million in federal Community Project funding the congressman secured for the Overton Park-Memphis Zoo Parking Solution Initiative.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a longtime advocate for ending the practice of horse soring – the intentional injury to horse legs to produce an exaggerated gait called the “Big Lick” – today applauded the U.S.
WASHINGTON -- Representatives Steve Cohen (TN-9), Dina Titus (NV-01) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) today re-introduced the Horse Transportation Safety Act that would ban the transportation of horses across state lines in “double decker” trucks or trailers containing two or more levels on top of one another.
WASHINGTON -- Congressmen Steve Cohen (TN-9), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Vern Buchanan (FL-16) and Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) have introduced the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act to ban the harmful practice of “soring” horses. The legislation is endorsed by the Humane Society Legislative Fund.

The arts play a vital role in our community's economic growth and in providing cultural and educational benefits as well. I am pleased to have received an A+ on the Americans for the Arts Action Fund Congressional Scorecard.
Art in Memphis
I am acutely aware of the role the arts community plays in the Memphis economy, as well as its role in establishing Memphis's unique atmosphere and culture. Memphis is recognized internationally as a haven and home for established and aspiring artists alike.
A 2012 Creative Industries report released by Americans for the Arts shows that Memphis is home to 1,740 arts-related businesses, and that these businesses employ 8,275 people. These are real jobs that contribute to our local economy and to our local pocketbooks. These jobs help to keep Memphis established as a cornerstone of tourism, which furthers economic development.
As a State Senator I worked to establish the Tennessee license plate "art is…a rainbow" which provides partial funding for the Tennessee Arts Commission.
National Endowment of the Arts
As a long-time supporter of the arts, I strongly oppose any cuts that would negatively impact the NEA's ability to provide grants and other funding to arts-based businesses in Memphis. I have consistently voted against amendments to the federal budget and appropriation bills which would cut funding to the NEA as well as other organizations and programs that support the arts and jobs.
Art in Classrooms
Throughout my legislative career, I've advocated for more arts education, specifically more public arts education. The arts should not be viewed as an ‘add-on' to core educational programs but recognized as an integral part of a complete education.
Arts education programs provide various benefits for our youth and the workforce and therefore, it is important to find ways to make sure that arts academic courses receive equal support as math and science courses. I continue to support measures that prepare our future workforce through innovation and creativity in the schools through a well-rounded education.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the Blues City Cultural Center, a non-profit performing arts and visual arts organization founded in 1979, will receive a $25,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a project exploring the history of the Orange Mound community.
The project’s title is “This is Orange Mound: Past Reflections and Future Directions.”

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the Metal Museum, formerly the National Ornamental Metal Museum, will be receiving a $500,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for its continuing efforts.  The Metal Museum is devoted to exhibitions of metalwork and public programs featuring metalsmiths.  It is the only institution of its kind in North America and one of only a few in the world devoted exclusively to metalwork.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09), Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, today presided at a hearing "Examining the History and Importance of ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing' " and H.R. 301, a bill introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina that would make the song America's national hymn.

One of the main responsibilities of Congress is to determine how taxpayer dollars are distributed throughout the nation. I work hard to make sure that programs that will help the Ninth District receive adequate funding. It is important that we ensure economic security for hard-working American families and small businesses by providing adequate funding for our nation's transportation projects, Social Security and Medicare, and medical research.
I am proud to have supported budgets that prioritize job creation, financing public investments, strengthening the middle and working classes, and raising adequate revenue to meet budgetary needs while simultaneously restoring fairness to the tax code, protecting social insurance programs, and ensuring fiscal sustainability for years to come.
Public Investments
In 2015, I voted in favor of the bipartisan Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which secured funding for important government programs, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It extended the Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) through 2019, delayed the implementation of the "Cadillac Tax" until 2020, and made additional investments in Head Start and early childhood development, among many other provisions. Also, I am proud to have secured an extra $4 million in the budget to help reduce the backlog of untested rape kits in Memphis.
In 2014, I supported the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) budget when it was offered as a substitute to the Republican Budget. The CPC budget would have made significant investments aimed at getting Americans back to work. These investments would have created jobs, repaired and modernized our nation's roads, bridges, and water infrastructure, fostered investment in teachers and schools, and provided training programs for the nation's unemployed.
Protecting Medicare and Social Security
I have consistently voted to protect funding for Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security to ensure that these programs remain solvent for future generations. I will not vote to make severe cuts to these programs because I believe that given our current economic climate it would be inhumane of us to not provide aid to those individuals who need it the most.
Scale Back Tax Cuts
While I wish to see the United States return to a fiscally responsible budget, I do not believe that we should attempt to balance our budget by asking the poor and the middle class to contribute more than wealthier Americans. I continue to believe that the only realistic way to balance our nation's budget is to scale back needless business subsidies and end the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. By requiring the wealthiest to pay their fair share we could put America on track for a balanced budget without putting a burden on the middle class.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) went to the House floor Wednesday evening to speak against a Republican budget resolution aimed at requiring massive cuts to the social safety net programs in order to give a tax cut to millionaires and billionaires.

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today voted for a continuing appropriations resolution (known as a CR) to keep the government operating beyond the September 30 fiscal year deadline and until December 20.

Children and Families

Issues
It is important to provide all children and families access to a quality, affordable education and healthcare to help them secure a prosperous future. As a member of Congress, I have championed for legislation that makes it easier for Americans to balance work and family responsibilities, expands support for foster youth care, and serves the needs of children with special behavioral health needs and/or medical disabilities. I also firmly believe that assisting families in their pursuit of higher education is critical for our nation's growth and success.
I have the great honor of serving on the House Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over a wide range of issues including criminal justice system, civil rights, civil liberties, and voting rights. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, I take my oversight duties very seriously.
I currently serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which has jurisdiction over all constitutional amendments and federal civil right laws among other issues. Making sure that my constituents' rights are not infringed upon is of the utmost importance to me. Toward that end, I am devoted to protecting the voting rights of all Americans, working to reform the criminal justice system, and ensuring that education is accessible to all people.
Incidents of unarmed African Americans dying at the hands of police in cities such as Memphis, Baltimore, Ferguson, New York City and others have led to many protests across America. While most police officers spend their careers admirably protecting the communities they serve, it is unfortunate that there have been a string of incidents where some officers discharged their weapons against unarmed African Americans. Disparities in the criminal justice system and the death of unarmed African Americans have fueled calls for reform. As someone who has always supported civil rights and liberties for all people, I am particularly concerned about the systemic causes of the protests and unrest in these communities.
I am also deeply disturbed by recent challenges to voting rights and attempts to suppress votes in minority communities. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and I am working to protect this right and make it easier for Americans to exercise it.
Protecting Civil Rights
Voting Rights The Congressman has cosponsored numerous pieces of legislation to safeguard access to online voter registration and same day registration, to push for poll workers that are informed and reliable, to create a national voter hotline, and to ensure that all provisional ballots are counted votes. He introduced the Streamlining and Improving Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act , to ensure that every state allows citizens to vote for at least 15 days prior to federal elections and require that states provide adequate poll workers and other resources to prevent wait times of longer than one hour.
In response to the Supreme Court's decision that down portions of the landmark Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Voting Rights Advancement Act to establish a new, nationwide coverage formula for preclearance and make improvements to the law. In addition, he has cosponsored legislation to require states to automatically register anyone who provides identifying information to the state's department of motor vehicles, as well as, legislation that allows voters to provide a sworn, written statement attesting to their identification as a means by which to meet voter identification requirements. The Congressman has also cosponsored constitutional amendments that explicitly guarantee that every U.S. citizen of legal voting age has a fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which he or she resides.
Racial Profiling
Congressman Cohen has cosponsored legislation that prohibits law enforcement from engaging in racial profiling, grants victims of racial profiling the right to file suit, authorizes grants to collect data relating to racial profiling, and requires state and local law enforcement to certify that they have eliminated any practices that permit or encourage racial profiling. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the End Racial Profiling Act. Police Reform
When, where and against whom police use deadly force is a serious issue that deserves both urgent attention and careful thought. Unfortunately, no meaningful statistics are kept to help us understand how to best prevent deadly force from being used inappropriately. The Congressman believes that states should be required to collect data on all instances in which deadly force is used by police and report that information to the U.S. Department of Justice. The required reporting would include the race, ethnicity, gender, and age of the individual against whom the deadly force was used as well as an explanation as to why non-lethal efforts were not employed or were ineffective. For this reason, the Congressman introduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act, which would close a loophole in federal law that prevents adequate collection of comprehensive national data regarding justified and unjustified use of deadly force with police. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the Congressman is continuing to press for vitally important legislation that will ensure that our community is safe while respecting the difficult job our men and women in law enforcement perform every day. Congressman Cohen introduced Police Training and Independent Review Act which would create an incentive for states to require independent investigation and prosecution of incidents in which police use of deadly force results in a death or injury. The bill would require sensitivity training requirements regarding racial bias, cultural diversity, and interactions with the disabled, mentally ill, and new immigrants. His bill has been endorsed by the NAACP, the Chicago Tribune, and has the support of the majority of the Congressional Black Caucus. He also introduced the Police Creating Accountability in Making Effective Recording Available (CAMERA) Act , a grant program that would assist state and local law enforcement with the purchase of body cameras to be worn by police officers. The Congressman believes that this country can do better than to allow unarmed youth to be unnecessarily chased, shot, and ultimately killed without any punishment of the perpetrator. We have a real problem in this country when it comes to the relationship between police and communities of color, which they are sworn to protect and serve. The Congressman has dedicated his career to fighting for civil rights and civil liberties, and as the Ranking Member of the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee, he is continuing to follow these issues closely. Gender Equality Congressman Cohen has been a tireless advocate for women's equality in Congress. He believes that it is important that women are not denied their reproductive rights. He stands with Planned Parenthood and the essential preventative health services such as mammograms, HIV testing, and access to birth control that it provides. The Congressman remains committed to fighting for women's health care and opposes any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood or repeal the Affordable Care Act that could put many low-income and minority women at risk. He has also worked to ensure that women have the ability to protect their rights against wage discrimination. The Congressman cosponsored The Paycheck Fairness Act because he believes that with increased information on wage data and a commitment to eradicating wage discrepancies, our nation's women would be better prepared to recognize and enforce their rights. The Congressman has been a long-time supporter of women's rights initiatives, especially when it pertains to making personal decisions regarding women's health and family. He believes that it is important to ensure affordable abortion coverage and care for every woman. He has long been a strong supporter of a woman's right to choose and believes that this choice is one that should remain between a woman and her doctor. The Congressman is committed to continuing to fight for women's rights here and abroad, and continuing to urge his House and Senate colleagues in Congress to do the same.
The Congressman was honored to attend the Women's March in Memphis.
Reducing the School to Prison Pipeline
Congressman Cohen offered an amendment to the Student Success Act, also known as the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act to allow Title II funds to be used for restorative justice and conflict resolution training. Using these techniques rather than suspension, expulsion or involving the police has been proven to reduce the School to Prison Pipeline. Similar language was included in the Senate version of the bill which was ultimately signed into law by President Obama.

Fighting Crime and Seeking Justice
Congressman Cohen offered an amendment to a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations package to increase funding by $4 million for programs to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits . The amendment was adopted by the House of Representatives on September 12, 2017, and the package containing it was approved the House of Representatives on September 14, 2017. Ultimately, $2.5 million of this increase was enacted into law in the final package adopted in 2018. The amendment built upon similar amendments offered by Congressman Cohen that have also been enacted into law. In 2014, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by $5 million. In 2015, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by an additional $4 million. Including the increase prompted by Congressman Cohen's most recent amendment, the program has seen an overall increase from $36 million to $47.5 million since 2014 – a nearly 32% increase.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to require a background check for nearly every gun sale or transfer, and a cosponsor of the Enhanced Background Checks Act (H.R. 1112) to close the loophole that allowed the shooter in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina to obtain a gun. The Brady Act mandates criminal background checks for all gun sales at licensed firearm dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). While the vast majority of checks are processed within minutes, if NICS has not completed its background check after three days, the dealer is allowed to proceed with the sale. The Enhanced Background Checks Act allows for more time to complete the background check . To help reduce gun violence, Congressman Cohen has cosponsored the Assault Weapons Ban which prohibits the sale, transfer, production, and importation of: semi-automatic rifles and pistols with a military-style feature that can accept a detachable magazine, semi-automatic rifles with a fixed magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds, semi-automatic shotguns with a military-style feature, any ammunition feeding device that can hold more than 10 rounds, and 205 specifically-named and listed firearms. He has also cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act which prohibits the sale of bump stocks, which modify semi-automatic rifles to replicate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. Bump stocks were added to weapons used by the Mandalay Bay Hotel shooter. This legislation bans the possession of any fire arms accessory that accelerates the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Raise the Age Act to prohibit the licensing, selling or delivering certain semiautomatic weapons to persons under 21 years of age. The bill allows for exceptions for individuals who are members of the Armed Forces on active duty, or a full-time government employee whose official duties requires the carrying of a firearm. Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act to require the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report the number of guns transferred as a result of a failure to complete a background check within three days, as well as what occurred after it was discovered that someone received a gun who was ineligible to have received it, a cosponsor of a resolution to establish a Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention , and a cosponsor of the Gun Violence Research Act to give the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the authority to research the causes injuries due to gun violence as well as ways to prevent them. It will also improve the National Violent Death Reporting System and enable health care providers to report threats of violence. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the effects of gun violence on mental health in minority communities. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Buyback our Safety Act to authorize $15 million over 5 years to establish a new matching grant at the Department of Justice to bolster local gun buyback initiatives, and the End Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act to require that all 50 states provide information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on individuals who are committed to a mental institution or who express a threat of violence to a mental health professional. To reduce drunk driving deaths, Congressman Cohen introduced the DUI Reporting Act . This bipartisan bill would requires driving under the influence (DUI) arrests to be reported to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database as a condition of receipt of full Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant funding, to stop repeat DUI offenders from being mistakenly charged as "first-time" offenders. Congressman Cohen is cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act . The legislation authorizes grants to develop and enforce firearm surrender policies, survivor safety and legal assistance to dependent children in appropriate circumstances. It also improves services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, extends the Rape Prevention and Education grant program, expands grants to help public health officials increase capacity for early childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, expands housing protections for survivors, and expands firearms laws to prohibit persons convicted of dating violence and stalking from possessing firearms.

Applicants who are denied could reapply once every two years. Once seven years have elapsed since an offender has completed his or her sentence, expungement will be automatically granted. However, sex offenders and those who commit crimes causing a loss of over $25,000 will not be eligible for automatic expungement. The bill also encourages states to pass their own expungement laws for state offenses. States that pass a substantially similar law would receive a 5 percent increase in their Byrne funding while those that do not would lose 5 percent of their Byrne funds. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the Second Chance Reauthorization Act . This bill reauthorizes funding for programs to help inmates become productive and law abiding citizens after they are released. Programs include education, housing, job training, drug treatment and medical care. The Congressman has also cosponsored the Fair Chance Act . This "ban the box" bill prohibits federal agencies and contractors from requesting that applicants for employment disclose certain criminal activity in their history records before receiving a conditional offer.
He has also cosponsored the No Money Bail Act to eliminate the payment of money as a condition of pretrial release of criminal defendants .
Congressman Cohen voted for the First STEP Act. Signed into law in 2018, the measure gives judges more latitude to work around mandatory sentences where appropriate, and allows offenders who were sentenced before Congress reduced the disparity between penalties for crack and powder cocaine in 2010 to petition to have their cases re-evaluated for possible sentence reductions. It also enables certain prisoners to participate in evidence-based recidivism reduction programs to earn credits to complete the last portion of their sentence in a residential reentry center or home confinement, and encourages the placement of offenders at prisons closer to their homes where possible. The law also prohibits the shackling of pregnant women. The Congressman has also introduced several bills to improve police practices including the Police Training and Independent Review Act , which he introduced with Congressman Lacy Clay (D-MO) of Ferguson, Missouri, and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). The legislation creates an incentive for states to require independent investigation and prosecution of incidents in which police use of deadly force results in a death or injury. It also requires sensitivity training on ethnic and racial bias, cultural diversity, and interactions with the disabled, mentally ill, and new immigrants. The bill is supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Congressman Cohen has also introduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act to require states, as a condition of receipt of full Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding, to collect data in all instances in which deadly force was used and report it to the Department of Justice, and the Police Creating Accountability in Making Effective Recording Available (CAMERA) Act to establish a grant program to assist state and local law enforcement with the purchase of body cameras to be worn by police officers. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the End Racial Profiling Act to prohibit law enforcement from engaging in racial profiling, grant victims of racial profiling the right to file suit, authorize grants to collect data relating to racial profiling, and require state and local law enforcement to certify that they have eliminated any practices that permit or encourage racial profiling . The bipartisan Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act places restrictions and transparency measures on the Defense Department's program that transfers excess military equipment to local law enforcement and prevents transfers of equipment such as grenade launchers, weaponized drones and armored military vehicles that are inappropriate for local policing.

Issues
As the Chairman on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, Congressman Cohen is working to protect civil rights as well as reform the criminal justice system to make it more fair. The Congressman is also working to support ex-offenders as they reenter society and become productive members of society. He introduced the Fresh Start Act to give nonviolent ex-offenders a chance to start over again. It allows them to apply for expungement to the court where they were sentenced and allows the United States Attorney for that District to submit recommendations to the court. Applicants who are denied could reapply once every two years. Once seven years have elapsed since an offender has completed his or her sentence, expungement will be automatically granted.

My votes for strict timelines for withdrawal from both Afghanistan and Iraq corresponded with the hundreds of responses I heard from people in the Ninth Congressional District.
The National Guard has been stretched too thin by extended tours overseas. Their primary function is to respond to emergencies within the United States. I believe they should be readily available to respond when needed during catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina.
Legislative efforts of the 115 th Congress:
Protecting the National Security Council from Political Interference Act (H.R. 804)
This bill prohibits staff whose positions are primarily political from being members of the National Security Council, and expresses a sense of Congress that there should be no limit on access to such meetings by the Director of National Intelligence and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Additionally, I have signed on to a letter to President Trump on February 1, 2017 asking the President to restore the Director of National Intelligence and Joint Chiefs to the National Security Council and explain his justification for including Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon was removed from the National Security Council on April 5, 2017. I also signed on to a letter to President Trump on February 10, 2017 asking that he suspend National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deny him access to classified material until an investigation into his actions regarding Russia is complete. Michael Flynn resigned on February 13, 2017.

This bill directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs (VA) to jointly establish the K-9 Companion Corps program for the awarding of grants to assist nonprofit organizations in establishing, planning, designing, and/or operating programs to provide assistance dogs to certain members of the Armed Forces and veterans who have certain disabilities. Defines "assistance dog" to mean a dog specifically trained to perform physical tasks to mitigate the effects of such a disability, except that such term does not include a dog specifically trained for comfort or personal defense. I also cosponsored it in the 114 th Congress.
Restore Honor to Service Members Act (H.R. 2904)
This bill requires appropriate military record correction boards or discharge review boards to review the discharge characterization of any former members of the Armed Forces requesting a review who were discharged because of their sexual orientation, and permits such boards to change a characterization to honorable if such characterization is any characterization except honorable. I also cosponsored it in the 114 th Congress.
Legislative Efforts of 114 th Congress
In 2015, I introduced the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015 (H.R. 4246). This bill, which was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2015, ensures that certain members of the National Guard and Reserves who fall on hard economic times after their military service will continue to obtain bankruptcy relief without having to fill out the substantial paperwork required by the so-called "means test" under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The bill extends the existing "means test" exception until 2019.
Other Defense Related Legislation In 2011, I introduced the Honor the Written Intent of Our Service member Heroes (WISH) Act (H.R. 1046). This bill allows soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen designate who they want to organize their funeral arrangements should they be killed while serving their country, even if the designated individuals is not a spouse, blood relative or adoptive parent. This legislation was supported by the Air Force Association, AMVETS, the Jewish War Veterans of the USA, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Association of Uniformed Services, the Reserve Officers Association, the United States Army Warrant Officers Association, and Vietnam Veterans of America. The legislation was ultimately included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (H.R. 1540), which passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Obama on December 31, 2011.
Additionally, I voted in favor of:

Issues
Generating jobs and strengthening the economy is one of Congressman Cohen's top priorities in Congress. Some of the efforts that Congressman Cohen has made to bring much needed economic revitalization to Memphis include: Economic Development Congressman Cohen helped to secure the $71.2 million Department of Transportation grant for the Lamar Avenue redevelopment project , an effort that has been a top priority for Congressman Cohen since he was elected to federal office. The project includes major roadway repairs and capacity upgrades to Lamar Avenue, a regionally and nationally important intermodal freight corridor and will facilitate truck traffic in and out of the BNSF intermodal freight facility, creating efficiencies in the movement of goods and bring jobs and economic growth to Memphis. Congressman Cohen helped Memphis secure a $30 million federal grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Choice Neighborhood program to redevelop Foote Homes and bring much needed revitalization to Memphis. Congressman Cohen helped Memphis acquire a $15 million TIGER grant for the Main to Main pedestrian and bike path project across the Harahan Bridge and other improvements to downtown Memphis infrastructure. Congressman Cohen helped Memphis-Shelby County Airport to be selected as one of ten federal test sites for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program (drones), a program overseen by the Department of Transportation that will increase the stature of Memphis as a center for this cutting-edge technology and burgeoning industry, ultimately bringing jobs and positive economic growth to the region. Economic Empowerment Congressman Cohen fought for years to secure funding for the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) Business Center in Memphis that led to a three year $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) in 2012. The MBDA is the only federal agency created specifically to foster the establishment and growth of minority-owned businesses in America. Congressman Cohen introduced the Supermarket Tax Credit for Underserved Areas to provide tax incentives for the establishment of supermarkets in food deserts. The bill increases the work employment tax credit to hire disadvantaged youth, community residents and veterans and also provides a credit of sales for fresh fruit and vegetables from local community gardens. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Pay Workers a Living Wage Act to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to strengthen the Equal Pay Act by providing effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work and protecting employees from retaliation for sharing salary information with their coworkers. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Credit Access and Inclusion Act to allow the use of non-financial service providers to provide customers' on-time payments to credit reporting agencies, including gas, electric, and telecommunications firms and landlords. The bill enables more predictive information of often-credit-invisible consumers to be utilized to establish credit. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Original Living Wage Act. The bill links the federal minimum wage to 15% over the federal poverty threshold for a family of four ($24,600) and increases the minimum wage automatically every four years to ensure that inflation does not diminish purchasing power. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Keep Our Pensions Promises Act to prohibit multiemployer pension plans from reducing retirees' monthly benefits and safeguard guaranteed benefits to ensure participants from companies that leave multiemployer plans, and subsequently stop paying into them, will continue to receive benefits. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Restoring Overtime Pay Act to support overtime protections and robust wages for working people by pegging the salary threshold to the 40 th percentile of wages in the lowest wage census region and requires automatic updates every three years to ensure the threshold remains in-line with overall increases in workers' wages. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Schedules that Work Act to provide relief to workers facing irregular and unpredictable schedules. It would require that retail, food service, and cleaning employees receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance. Though schedules may later be changed, one hour's worth of extra pay is required for schedules changed with less than 24 hours' notice. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to require employers to make reasonable, low-cost, non-disruptive accommodations to employees who have limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Consumer Protection Congressman Cohen introduced the Fair Access to Credit Scores Act to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to provide all consumers with a free credit score each year. In January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered credit reporting agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23.2 million in fines for deceiving consumers about the usefulness and cost of credit scores they bought from credit reporting agencies. Congressman Cohen introduced the Equal Employment for All Act along with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to amend the Fair Credit and Reporting Act to prohibit the use of consumer credit checks against prospective and current employees for the purposes of making adverse employment decisions. Congressman Cohen cosponsored a Congressional Review Act resolution to nullify the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) rollback of net neutrality protections. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Comprehensive Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act to make sweeping reforms to safeguard consumers' personally identifiable information from future attacks similar to the Equifax breach, provide affordable access to credit freezing services, and shorten the time period that adverse credit remains on the record. Congressman Cohen introduced the Tax Return Preparer Accountability Act to give the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) explicit authority to ensure that paid tax preparers are adequately trained and maintain high standards of integrity protect consumers from fraudulent tax preparation businesses. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates to establish a maximum Annual Percentage Rate of 36 percent and applies this cap to all open-end and closed-end consumer credit transactions, including mortgages, car loans, credit cards, overdraft loans, car title loans, refund anticipation loans, and payday loans. Congressman Cohen cosponsored the Return to Prudent Banking Act to reinstate the Glass Steagall Act to revive the separation between commercial banking and investment banking by increasing federal oversight over large investment banks but maintaining the flexibility of smaller, local community banks.
Education is a priority for families in the Ninth District. I am honored to represent the district's many schools, enrichment centers, and institutions of higher education. Education has been one of the focal points of my career, and I believe everyone should have access to a quality education.
For nearly 20 years, I worked tirelessly as a Tennessee State Senator to initiate and pass the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program to fund college scholarships, after-school programs, and pre-K education for Tennessee's students. Since the inception of the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program in 2004, over $4 billion has gone to Tennessee students continuing their education at the college level.
Today, I am proud to continue working to improve education in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout my career in Congress, I have introduced legislation aimed at improving educational access and standards for students of all ages.
FUNDING AND ACCESS
I introduced the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 1674). The bill ensures privately issued student loans will once again be treated like other consumer debt and be dischargeable in bankruptcy. Due to changes Congress made to bankruptcy laws 10 years ago, student loans made by private, for-profit lenders are currently very difficult to discharge in bankruptcy.
I introduced the bipartisan Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers (POST) Act (H.R. 4101). This bill helps stop for-profit colleges from aggressively targeting veterans and active-duty service members by eliminating the powerful financial incentives that cause them to do so.

I introduced the Protections and Regulation for Our (PRO) Students Act (H.R. 2192) with my colleagues to protect. This bill protects students from deceitful practices and bad actors in the for-profit college industry. It provides stricter guidelines for colleges, ensures that students have access to important and accurate information and data, strengthens oversight and regulation, and holds schools accountable for violations and poor performance.
I am a co-sponsor of the Put School Counselors Where They're Needed Act (H.R.2022). This bill authorizes a demonstration program to place additional professional secondary school counselors in high schools with drop-out rates of 40 percent or more.
I introduced the Restorative Justice in Schools Act , which would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to allow local educational agencies to use the funds to provide professional development activities that train school personnel to use restorative justice as a means of conflict resolution. Restorative justice is a method that aims to resolve conflicts between students in a manner that focuses on the victim and the offender of a wrong-doing. Unlike traditional punishment, this can prevent the use of penalties such as incarceration that are often times, too harsh, expensive, and counter-productive, leading to repeat offenses. The amendment passed the House on July 8, 2015 and similar language was included in the final bill, which President Obama signed into law on December 10, 2015.
I introduced the Positive Reduction of Incarceration by Maximizing Education (PRIME) Act , which is a means to promote the choice of education vs. incarceration. About one in every ten young male high school dropouts is in jail or juvenile detention, compared with one in thirty-five young male high school graduates. This legislation arises out of research that has demonstrated increased education is directly related to reduce incarceration. America's youth must be exposed to the concrete benefits of academic accomplishment.
SAFTEY
I cosponsored The Keeping All Students Safe Act (H.R. 4247), in order to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraint and seclusion in schools. This act will protect our youth from physical or mental abuse, aversive behavioral interventions that compromise health and safety, and any physical restraint or seclusion imposed solely for purposes of discipline or convenience, in order to ensure physical restraint and seclusion are imposed in school only when a student's behavior poses an imminent danger of physical injury to the student, school personnel, or others.
TEACHERS
I introduced the Maximizing Opportunity and Retaining Experienced Teachers Act (MORE Teachers Act) to help address teacher shortages and retain qualified, experienced teachers. The legislation, which is supported by both the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, would make teachers who teach in geographic areas with teacher shortages and those who teach an underserved subject matter eligible for up to $17,500 of federal loan forgiveness if they stay in their position for 5 years.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the Shelby County Board of Education will receive a grant of $7,446,186 for its Head Start projects from January through June 29 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Head Start.

Education
More on Education
Issues
Education is a priority for families in the Ninth District. I am honored to represent the district's many schools, enrichment centers, and institutions of higher education. Education has been one of the focal points of my career, and I believe everyone should have access to a quality education. For nearly 20 years, I worked tirelessly as a Tennessee State Senator to initiate and pass the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program to fund college scholarships, after-school programs, and pre-K education for Tennessee's students. Since the inception of the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program in 2004, over $4 billion has gone to Tennessee students continuing their education at the college level. Today, I am proud to continue working to improve education in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout my career in Congress, I have introduced legislation aimed at improving educational access and standards for students of all ages. FUNDING AND ACCESS I introduced the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 1674). The bill ensures privately issued student loans will once again be treated like other consumer debt and be dischargeable in bankruptcy. Due to changes Congress made to bankruptcy laws 10 years ago, student loans made by private, for-profit lenders are currently very difficult to discharge in bankruptcy. I introduced the bipartisan Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers (POST) Act (H.R. 4101). This bill helps stop for-profit colleges from aggressively targeting veterans and active-duty service members by eliminating the powerful financial incentives that cause them to do so. PERFORMANCE I introduced the Protections and Regulation for Our (PRO) Students Act (H.R. 2192) with my colleagues to protect.

Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong proponent of efforts to lower energy costs, invest in renewable energy resources, promote energy independence and create a stronger more secure economy. Increasing the nation's overall energy efficiency requires a multifaceted approach. The National Resources Defense Council reports that America's energy bill will increase by $420 billion annually within the next five years if we do nothing to reduce our dependence on oil and fossil fuels. That amounts to $3,500 annually for every family in the nation.
It is also important to address the issue of skyrocketing gas prices. There is a misconception that simply increasing production by allowing more drilling is going to magically lower gas prices. However, since 2000, the amount of drilling has increased dramatically over the past four years. In fact, since 2003, the federal government has issued far more drilling permits than the oil companies have acted on. Nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is in areas that are already open for exploration. We have to enact legislation to force oil companies to drill on the more than million acres of land that they have leased, yet remain unused.
We must also develop a comprehensive plan to address the serious energy crisis that this country faces. We cannot drill our way out of this problem given that the U.S. contains 2.2 percent of world oil reserves and consumes 25.9 percent of the world's oil consumption. Rather than invoking our brawn, we must utilize our brains and innovate, as Americans have done for generations. We can no longer afford to throw our limited federal dollars at the feet of oil giants, and must begin investing in American ingenuity and create an American clean energy economy.
For me the choice is clear, either we can drill our way further into oil dependence, turn a blind eye to the destruction of the environment while we suck out and burn every last drop of oil, and we can exacerbate public health and wellness with the extraction and consumption of dirty fuels; or we can create a new energy economy that creates millions of jobs and protects the environment and public health of future generations.
114th Congress:
I offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2028) to increase funding by $2 million (a 25% increase) for the SuperTruck II program . The House of Representatives passed the amendment on April 29, 2015. The Department of Energy’s SuperTruck II program seeks to make dramatic improvements in the freight efficiency of heavy-duty Class 8 long-haul and regional-haul vehicles. Improvements include hybridization, more efficient idling, and high efficiency HVAC technologies. An increase to the account that funds this program was included in the H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, also known as the FY2016 Omnibus bill.
I am a cosponsor of the New Energy for America Act (H.R. 2412) . This bill extends the energy tax credit for energy property, including solar energy property, qualified fuel cell property, qualified microturbine property, combined heat and power system property, and thermal energy property.
I am also a cosponsor of the Job Creation through Energy Manufacturing Act of 2015 (H.R. 2296) . This bill authorizes $250 million in funding to establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program at the Department of Energy to provide competitive grants to states to establish or expand programs to finance energy efficient retrofits, onsite clean and renewable energy, smart grids, and alternative vehicle fleet projects for industrial businesses.
Other legislative highlights:
H.R. 5821 - The 10 Million Solar Roofs Act
Recently, I introduced, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the 10 Million Solar Roofs Act. If enacted, this legislation would be the single largest investment in solar technology in U.S. history. Even though the United States invented the solar cell, other nations such as Germany and Spain have outpaced us in terms of solar energy deployment. Scaling up production in the United States has been difficult because the initial costs of solar remain a large barrier to entry.
This legislation would help individuals and businesses overcome the initial cost barrier by providing funds for rebates, loans, and other incentives to eligible individuals or entities for the installation of solar energy systems. By incentivizing and expanding the adoption of solar technology, this bill would lead to the creation of 30,000 megawatts of new solar energy in the U.S., creating, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the largest solar market in the world in the U.S. Doing so would create up to 1.35 million green jobs in the next 10 years.
Solar energy is as reliable as the sunrise. And by harnessing the sun's infinite power, we can create abundant, clean energy to power an even stronger economy. The legislation I have introduced, if enacted, will create 10 million small power plants located on the roofs of American homes and businesses and more than one million green jobs. And thanks to Sharp Solar's presence in Memphis, many of these new green jobs will be located in Memphis.
The Gulf Oil Spill
On April 20 th , the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded killing 11 crew members and creating an oil spill that has now become the worst environmental catastrophe in U.S. history. I commend the President and his Administration for doing everything possible, in the face of incredibly adversity, to minimize the damage of the spill on both the economy and environment of the Gulf Region.
The Deepwater Horizon Rig activities were considered by all to be a low risk drilling exploration, a classification that scares me given the countless riskier drilling ventures occurring along the coasts of this great nation. This tragedy demonstrates that no matter how technologically advanced we become, we can never guarantee the safety of our environment and our citizens when it comes to dangerous and dirty energy sources like oil and coal. In the months of March and April 2010, we have seen 42 people die in dirty energy accidents - 29 in the Massey coal mine incident, 11 in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and another two miners in an accident in Kentucky.
We have also witnessed the ecological and economic damage an incident like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill can have on dozens of species and thousands of small businesses. It is time for America to develop clean, safe energy sources that create millions of well-paying, safe jobs and enhance the environment rather than destroy it.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act includes funding for home weatherization, smart grid technology, energy-efficient buildings and as well as tax incentives to spur investment in renewable energy and green job creation. Among its provisions, the law:
The American Clean Energy and Security Act
In the 111th Congress, the U.S. House of Representative passed H.R. 2454 (link is external) , the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This legislation includes provisions to lower greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy and decrease our dependence on foreign oil.
According an analysis by the Center for American Progress, Tennessee's Ninth Congressional district (TN-09) was listed as one of the Congressional districts who are least affected by the minimal cost from the energy bill. The lowest 28 percent income households in (TN-09) would actually receive an average net benefit of $40. ACES invests roughly $190 billion through 2025 in clean energy and energy efficiency programs, including: $90 billion in state programs to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency; $60 billion in carbon capture and sequestration technologies; $20 billion in electric and other advanced technology vehicles; and $20 billion in basic research and development into clean energy and energy efficiency.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, reports that investing in energy efficiency technology will save the average American household more than $4,000 by 2030. The bill also helps to create jobs - lots of good-paying jobs - in the new "green" industry that companies like Sharp Solar are poised to create. Also, the bill provides hundreds of millions of dollars for coal companies and oil refineries to help them overhaul and modernize their facilities to create even cheaper sources of electricity for people.
The American Clean Energy and Security Act - combined with the 2007 energy bill and the Obama Administration's plan to ramp up vehicle fuel efficiency standards - will cut the use of oil by more than five million barrels a day in 2030. That is equivalent to all the oil we currently import form the Middle East and Venezuela and one-fourth of our nation's current total daily consumption-and will save consumers more than $135 billion in fuel costs.
TVA
On December 22, 2008, a coal ash pond at Kingston, Tennessee, spilled five million cubic yards of water and coal fly ash onto 300 acres of land. It is believed that the TVA the coal ash spill is the largest in U.S. history and could cost billions of dollars in remediation and liabilities.
I subsequently wrote to the Tennessee Valley Authority on behalf of Memphis, Light Gas and Water (MLGW) requesting that TVA explore all possible means of recovering costs for the clean up of the spill to prevent passing along a potential cost increase to Tennessee utility customers. MLGW is the largest of TVA’s roughly 158 distributors and consumes about 10 percent of its electricity.
Consequently, MLGW customers, including 420,000 homes and businesses in Memphis and Shelby County, would stand to carry a considerable portion of any potential rate hike instituted as a consequence of the clean up.
It is critical for residents of the Tennessee Valley region that TVA has the means to continue to provide quality electrical service and promote economic development. Still, it is important that the TVA explore all possible means of recovering costs for the clean up of the spill.
Additionally, I have cosponsored the following pieces of legislation to lower energy costs, crack down on price gouging by oil companies, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and promote overall energy efficiency, all of which I am proud to have voted for: H.R. 152 (link is external) , the Home Heating Fuels Cost Relief Act Provides for a refundable tax credit for heating fuels and to create a grant program for States to provide individuals with loans to weatherize their homes. H.R. 890 (link is external) , the American Renewable Energy Act Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to implement and enforce a renewable electricity trading program, including requirements governing the issuance, tracking, and retirement of federal renewable electricity credits. H.R. 1778 (link is external) , the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) Program Act Provide for the establishment of national energy and environmental building retrofit policies for both residential and commercial buildings. H.R. 2129 (link is external) , the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act Makes it unlawful for any person to sell crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at a price that is unconscionably excessive or indicates the seller is taking unfair advantage unusual market conditions.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) led a letter to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner on Friday urging him to reverse the cancellation of contracts and the freezing of all funding associated with the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). Congressman Cohen announced $5.2 million in GRRP funding for Wesley Stage Park in Memphis and $11.4 million for the Broadmeadow Apartments in Covington in March 2024.
Fifteen Congressional colleagues co-signed the letter.
The letter reads:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that Young, Gifted and Green, a community environmental organization, will receive a community grant of $19,996,791 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The funding comes from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that only Congressman Cohen in the current Tennessee Congressional delegation voted for.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today applauded House passage of his bill, the TVA Salary Transparency Act, that he introduced with Representative Tim Burchett (TN-2). This bill aims to reinstate and modernize the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) annual reporting requirements to Congress concerning its management structure and the compensation of its top executives and managers.
WASHINGTON -- Congressmen Steve Cohen (TN-9) and Tim Burchett (TN-2) today reintroduced a measure ensuring the public has access to information about the salaries of Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) employees making more than $123,041 annually, or the maximum basic pay rate of a General Schedule Grade 15 (GS-15) Federal employee.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) and Senator Edward J. Markey (MA) led a letter to the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) with seven House and two Senate colleagues urging the federally owned electric utility agency to reconsider its focus on expanding gas-fired power generation and instead encourage and plan for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and distributed energy sources in its final Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, today announced two Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) Program grants from the Federal Railroad Administration totaling $26,269,987. The first, for $19,843,062, is for the conversion of eight Watco Company diesel locomotives to battery-electric, zero-emission locomotives. Watco operates the Memphis Dock Street Marine Terminal on Presidents Island. Congressman Cohen submitted a letter of support for the project.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW) will receive $11,423,844 for the permanent repair of the electrical distribution system damaged by the straight-line wind storms of July 18-21, 2023. The figure represents the 75 percent federal share of the $15,231,792 in actual damage.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today cheered the announcement that Elon Musk’s xAI company will be building the largest and most powerful supercomputer in history – the Gigafactory of Compute -- in the former Electrolux oven factory in Southwest Memphis, and made the following statement:
WASHINGTON --- Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the State of Tennessee will receive $2,484,530 from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program. The funding for the program came from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that only Congressman Cohen in the current Tennessee Congressional Delegation voted for.

Among its provisions, the law: Helps state and local governments make investments for innovative best practices to achieve greater energy efficiency and reduce energy usage, including building and home energy conservation programs, energy audits, fuel conservation programs, building retrofits, and "Smart Growth" planning and zoning. Provides $300 million in consumer rebates to buy energy efficient appliances to replace old ones to lower energy bills. Invests $500 million in training of workers for green-collar jobs. Improves the energy efficiency for up to 1 million modest-income homes through weatherization, expanding the number of families (from 150 percent to 200 percent of the federal poverty income levels) and the aid level (from $2,500 to $6,500 per household) to maintain the current per-household efficiency investment in the face of diminished state and other aid. This will save modest-income families on average $350 per year on heating and air conditioning bills, while creating up to 90,000 jobs. Provides grants of up to 30 percent of the cost of building a new renewable energy facility in 2009 and 2010 or permits that business to claim a 30 percent investment credit instead of a production tax credit. Promotes energy efficient investments in homes by extending and expanding tax credits through 2010 for investments such as new furnaces, energy-efficient windows and doors, or insulation. Increases the credit from 10 percent to 30 percent of the cost of the investment and raises the credit cap from $500 to $1,500, saving American families money on their energy bills. Spurs the next generation of cars by providing a tax credit for families that purchase plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles of up to $7,500. Provides clean renewable energy bonds for state and local governments, electric cooperatives and public power companies to finance renewable energy facilities to generate electricity. Increases incentives to install pumps that dispense alternative fuels including E85, biodiesel, hydrogen, and natural gas. More of these fuel pumps are needed for consumers with flex-fuel and alternative fuel vehicles. Makes an historic investment in upgrading federal buildings and making them energy efficient - working to save taxpayers over one billion dollars by slashing energy costs in our federal buildings by 25 percent.

Also, the bill provides hundreds of millions of dollars for coal companies and oil refineries to help them overhaul and modernize their facilities to create even cheaper sources of electricity for people. The American Clean Energy and Security Act - combined with the 2007 energy bill and the Obama Administration's plan to ramp up vehicle fuel efficiency standards - will cut the use of oil by more than five million barrels a day in 2030. That is equivalent to all the oil we currently import form the Middle East and Venezuela and one-fourth of our nation's current total daily consumption-and will save consumers more than $135 billion in fuel costs. TVA On December 22, 2008, a coal ash pond at Kingston, Tennessee, spilled five million cubic yards of water and coal fly ash onto 300 acres of land. It is believed that the TVA the coal ash spill is the largest in U.S. history and could cost billions of dollars in remediation and liabilities. I subsequently wrote to the Tennessee Valley Authority on behalf of Memphis, Light Gas and Water (MLGW) requesting that TVA explore all possible means of recovering costs for the clean up of the spill to prevent passing along a potential cost increase to Tennessee utility customers. MLGW is the largest of TVA’s roughly 158 distributors and consumes about 10 percent of its electricity. Consequently, MLGW customers, including 420,000 homes and businesses in Memphis and Shelby County, would stand to carry a considerable portion of any potential rate hike instituted as a consequence of the clean up. It is critical for residents of the Tennessee Valley region that TVA has the means to continue to provide quality electrical service and promote economic development. Still, it is important that the TVA explore all possible means of recovering costs for the clean up of the spill. Additionally, I have cosponsored the following pieces of legislation to lower energy costs, crack down on price gouging by oil companies, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and promote overall energy efficiency, all of which I am proud to have voted for: H.R. 152 (link is external) , the Home Heating Fuels Cost Relief Act Provides for a refundable tax credit for heating fuels and to create a grant program for States to provide individuals with loans to weatherize their homes. H.R. 890 (link is external) , the American Renewable Energy Act Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to implement and enforce a renewable electricity trading program, including requirements governing the issuance, tracking, and retirement of federal renewable electricity credits. H.R. 1778 (link is external) , the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) Program Act Provide for the establishment of national energy and environmental building retrofit policies for both residential and commercial buildings. H.R. 2129 (link is external) , the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act Makes it unlawful for any person to sell crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates at a price that is unconscionably excessive or indicates the seller is taking unfair advantage unusual market conditions.
In February 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading international network of scientists, for the first time concluded that global warming is "unequivocal" and that human activity is the main driver of it, causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950. Specifically, deforestation and an overdependence on fossil fuels have played a large part in the decline of our atmosphere and the loss of numerous natural resources. The Nature Conservancy reports that deforestation is responsible for 20-25 percent of all carbon emissions. Another 20 percent stem from automobiles and trucks.
Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report that expounds upon the IPCC findings and claims that climate change is undeniable and is the reason why the past decade is the warmest in the history of record-keeping. The report notes unmistakable upward trends in air temperatures from more than 7,000 weather stations all over the world.
Corporate interests have spent millions of dollars espousing mistruths about climate change and presenting a false choice to the American people - the idea that efforts to preserve our planet and ensure our own survival will destroy the American economy. However, this Congress has exposed these claims for what they really are - lies. The 111th Congress passed some of the most extensive and ambitious environmental legislation this country has seen since the 1970's. Furthermore, this Congress has proven that we can indeed strengthen the American economy and ensure that all Americans can breathe cleaner air and drink cleaner water. I am honored and proud to be a part of such a historic effort.
As a Member of Congress, I have supported numerous legislative initiatives and efforts aimed at addressing climate change and preserving our natural resources:
The Gulf Oil Spill
On April 20th, the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded killing eleven crew members and creating an oil spill that has now become the worst environmental catastrophe in U.S. history. I commend the President Obama and his Administration for doing everything possible, in the face of incredibly adversity, to minimize the damage of the spill on both the economy and environment of the Gulf Region.
The Deepwater Horizon Rig activities were considered by all to be a low risk drilling exploration, a classification that scares me given the countless riskier drilling ventures occurring along the coasts of this great nation. This tragedy demonstrates that no matter how technologically advanced we become, we can never guarantee the safety of our environment and our citizens when it comes to dangerous and dirty energy sources like oil and coal. In the months of March and April 2010, we have seen 42 people die in dirty energy accidents - 29 in the Massey coal mine incident, 11 in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and another two miners in an accident in Kentucky.
We have also witnessed the ecological and economic damage an incident like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill can have on dozens of species and thousands of small businesses. It is time for America to develop clean, safe energy sources that create millions of well-paying, safe jobs and enhance the environment rather than destroy it.
114th Legislative Highlights:
I voted against S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act . Congress approved the bill over Congressman Cohen’s objection before it was vetoed by President Obama. Congressman Cohen voted against overriding the President’s veto , and the veto was ultimately sustained.
I have been a staunch supporter of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan establishes the first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants. The final Clean Power Plan sets flexible and achievable standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, 9 percent more ambitious than the proposal.
I am a cosponsor of Climate Solutions Act of 2015 (H.R. 1971). This bill cuts carbon pollution to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Further, the bill empowers the Department of Energy to set a high national energy efficiency standard as well as a renewable energy portfolio goal of 4 percent of all electric energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050.
I am a cosponsor of Saving America’s Pollinators Act of 2015 (H.R. 1284). This bill requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take swift action to prevent future mass die-offs of pollinators and protect the health of honey bees and other critical pollinators by suspending the use of certain bee-toxic insecticides, known as neonicotinoids. It also requires the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator of the EPA, to monitor the health of native bee populations and to identify and publicly report the likely causes of bee kills.
Other legislative highlights:
H.R. 5821 - The 10 Million Solar Roofs Act
Recently, I introduced, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the 10 Million Solar Roofs Act. If enacted, this legislation would be the single largest investment in solar technology in U.S. history. Even though the United States invented the solar cell, other nations such as Germany and Spain have outpaced us in terms of solar energy deployment. Scaling up production in the United States has been difficult because the initial costs of solar remain a large barrier to entry.
This legislation would help individuals and businesses overcome the initial cost barrier by providing funds for rebates, loans, and other incentives to eligible individuals or entities for the installation of solar energy systems. By incentivizing and expanding the adoption of solar technology, this bill would lead to the creation of 30,000 megawatts of new solar energy in the U.S., creating, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the largest solar market in the world in the U.S. Doing so would create up to 1.35 million green jobs in the next 10 years.
Solar energy is as reliable as the sunrise. And by harnessing the sun's infinite power, we can create abundant, clean energy to power an even stronger economy. The legislation I have introduced, if enacted, will create 10 million small power plants located on the roofs of American homes and businesses and more than one million green jobs. And thanks to Sharp Solar's presence in Memphis, many of these new green jobs will be located in Memphis. American Clean Energy and Security Act In the 111th Congress, the U.S. House of Representative passed H.R. 2454 (link is external) , the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This legislation includes provisions to lower greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy and decrease our dependence on foreign oil. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the pollution caps proposed in ACES would reduce global warming pollution 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. The additional measures for tropical forest protection will achieve an additional 10 percent in reductions below 2005 levels by 2020. The bill also requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the latest global warming science and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review technological advancements and then make recommendations to the Administration. To make global warming pollution reductions more affordable, H.R. 2454 includes provisions to increase the efficiency of our buildings, lighting and appliances and promote greater efficiency in industry to ensure that we can deploy renewable energy across the country. These improvements will save consumers money, create jobs and lower emissions. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, reports that investing in energy efficiency technology will save the average American household more than $4,000 by 2030. According an analysis by the Center for American Progress, the lowest 28 percent income households in Tennessee's Ninth Congressional district (TN-09) would actually receive an average net benefit of $40. The bill also helps to create jobs in the new "green" industry that companies like Sharp Solar are poised to create. Also, the bill provides hundreds of millions of dollars for coal companies and oil refineries to help them overhaul and modernize their facilities to create even cheaper sources of electricity for people. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act In Feb. 2009, the U.S. Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5). The Recovery Act seeks in part to spur technological advances in science and health and to invest in environmental protection and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency manages over $7 billion in projects and programs that will help achieve these goals, offers resources to help other agencies "green" a much larger set of Recovery investments, and administers environmental laws that will govern Recovery activities. Additionally, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released $27,182,000 in funding through the Recovery Act for civil works projects to be completed in the 9th District. These funds will allow Corps the opportunity to accomplish work on ready-to-go water resources projects that will benefit the nation for years to come, such projects include shovel-ready construction operations in Memphis - from dredging and revetment efforts on the Mississippi River to maintenance projects for the Wolf River and Memphis Harbors and creation of dikes off the river. Other initiatives In April of this year, I sent a letter in support of funding assistance for the Mississippi River Corridor in Tennessee (MRCT) through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Emerging Technologies Grant Program. This program will enable the MRCT to partner with professional companies in providing significant reductions in particulate matter from barges operating along the Mississippi River. The MRCT is a non-profit organization based in Memphis and is the leading advocate in the promotion of transportation and improved air quality along the river. I have also spearheaded a letter to appropriators, requesting that Recovery Act funding be allocated towards zoos and aquariums. Zoos and aquariums are leaders in environmental education. In the last 10 years zoos and aquariums formally trained more than 400,000 teachers. They have enhanced local and regional economies, collectively generating $8.4 billion in annual economic activity and supporting more than 100,000 jobs. Additionally, during the 111th Congress, I have cosponsored the following pieces of legislation to protect the environment:
H.R. 515 (link is external) , the Radioactive Import Deterrence Act Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from issuing a license authorizing the importation into the United States of: (1) low-level radioactive waste or (2) specific radioactive waste streams exempted from regulation by the NRC. H.R. 644 (link is external) , Grand Canyon Watersheds Protection Act Withdraws acres in the vicinity of Kanab Creek and House Rock Valley from all forms of entry, appropriation and disposal under federal public land laws. H.R. 669 (link is external) , Nonnative Wildlife Invasion Prevention Act Requires the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations establishing a process for assessing the risk of all nonnative wildlife species proposed for importation into the United States. H.R. 980 (link is external) , the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act Designates certain National Forest System lands and public lands in the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming as protected wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, wild land recovery areas, and biological connecting corridors. H.R. 1310 (link is external) , the Clean Water Protection Act Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify that fill material cannot be comprised of waste. H.R. 1666 (link is external) , the Safe Markets Development Act Establishes an auction and revenue collection mechanism for a carbon market that ensures price stability with environmental integrity. H.R. 1778 (link is external) , the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) Program Act Provides for the establishment of national energy and environmental building retrofit policies for both residential and commercial buildings. H.R. 1925 (link is external) , the America's Red Rock Wilderness Act Designates specified lands in Colorado and Utah as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) led a letter to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner on Friday urging him to reverse the cancellation of contracts and the freezing of all funding associated with the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP).

In light of the Great Recession of 2008, during which Memphis and the nation suffered an unprecedented foreclosure crisis in large part due to unfair, under-regulated and predatory mortgage lending practices, Congressman Cohen strongly supports efforts to prevent future foreclosure crises and dangerous housing market practices.
During the years preceding the mortgage crisis, too many mortgages were made to consumers without regard to the consumer's ability to repay the loans. Loose underwriting practices by some creditors contributed to a mortgage crisis that led to the nation's most serious recession since the Great Depression.
Congressman Cohen voted for the Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in 2010 by President Barack Obama, to reform the U.S. financial industry in order to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 market crash, and continues to oppose efforts to reverse the protections put into the law as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Congressman Cohen is a Member of the Commission on Security & Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), also known as the U.S. Helsinki Commission , which seeks to improve security by promoting human rights, democracy and cooperation on economic, environmental and military issues in 57 countries. As a Commissioner, he has attended numerous hearings, briefings and meetings on these issues in Washington, DC, participated in every Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and has traveled to Helsinki member states on official travel to meet with foreign elected officials.
Supporting NATO and Countering Russian Aggression
Congressman Cohen introduced a resolution to express support for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (H.Res.256). The resolution recognizes that NATO remains the most important and critical security link between the United States and Europe. It also recognizes the United States' strong commitment to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and democratic development of the countries that have emerged from the former Soviet Union, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova. H.Res.256 passed the House of Representatives on July 11, 2018.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act which establishes new sanctions, and enhances existing sanctions, against entities related to Russia, Iran and North Korea. It codifies and strengthens current sanctions contained in executive orders on Russia imposed by President Obama in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine and Moscow's interference in the U.S. presidential election and gives Congress an opportunity to reject presidential efforts to waive or terminate those and certain other sanctions. The bill passed the House of Representatives on July 25, 2017 by 419-3 and the U.S. Senate on July 27, 2017 by 98-2 and became law on August 2, 2017.
Congressman Cohen is the sponsor of Punishing Continued Occupation of Ukraine Act which would punish Russia's continued occupation of Crimea by targeting Russian financial institutions which are the soft underbelly of President Putin's regime. He is also a cosponsor of Secure America from Russian Interference Act which increases sanction on Russia and includes Punishing Continued Occupation of Ukraine Act.
Cuban Relations
Congressman Cohen has long supported normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba. He supported President Obama's steps to normalize relations with Cuba and has cosponsored the Promoting American Agricultural and Medical Exports to Cuba Act and the Free Trade With Cuba Act . These bills aim to lift restrictions on exports of agriculture and medical goods to Cuba, ease travel restrictions to and from Cuba for U.S. citizens or legal residents, and repeal the embargo on trade with Cuba, respectively. He has also written to the Cuban government in support of medical diplomacy with Memphis health institutions.
Syrian Refugees and Immigration Restriction
Congressman Cohen has remained adamantly opposed to President Trump's anti-refugee and immigration rhetoric. In a time when millions are suffering, it is our duty as Americans to find ways to help, not to isolate ourselves. For this reason, Congressman Cohen has taken action to counteract President Trump's refugee ban including cosponsoring the Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) 2.0 Act to prohibit the use of federal funds from being used to implement President Trump's ban. Congressman Cohen also signed on to a letter urging federal departments to comply with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision to overturn the travel ban that would have prevented people from several countries, including Syria, to travel to the U.S.
Israel
Israel has been our closest friend and ally in the Middle East since 1948 when the U.S. became the first country to recognize the establishment of the Jewish state. Our nearly seven decades long relationship has contributed to the national security of both of our countries and remains as important today as it was during the tumultuous first 20 years of Israel's existence. This is why the safety, security and right of Israel to exist as a democratic Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state has been Congressman Cohen's focus when considering any legislation or actions pertaining to Israel or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Iran Nuclear Deal
Congressman Cohen voted for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, which passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Obama on May 22, 2015. This bill gave Congress 60 days to review the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) before conducting a vote of disapproval. The JCPOA is an historic agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. After carefully reviewing the JCPOA and listening to constituents who oppose and support the agreement as well as speaking personally with President Obama and Secretary Kerry about the agreement, meeting with U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Dan Baer, attending classified briefings and meetings with officials at the Vienna headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency while on official travel, and speaking with Asian officials and diplomats, he voted to approve the JCPOA as a diplomatic way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and avoid possible military action. Congressman Cohen is concerned that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal will cause more instability in the region and will cause Iran to move towards a nuclear bomb.
We strongly condemn the continued detention of three Ukrainian nationals — Vadym Golda, Maxim Petrov, and Dmytro Shabanov — all former OSCE officials who were unjustly arrested and convicted following farce trials by the Russian-controlled “supreme courts” in the occupied territories of Ukraine. We call on the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally release them. Their incarceration is a travesty of justice and an affront to the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and all international institutions committed to peace, accountability, and the rule of law.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today reintroduced the Baseball Diplomacy Act to eliminate barriers to Cuban athletes entering the U.S. on non-immigrant visas during the baseball season and then returning home when the season ends.

Regardless of personal background or political leanings, we all share a concern for access to health care for ourselves and our families. Congressman Cohen is committed to making quality and comprehensive health care more affordable and more accessible. Congressman Cohen will continue to work with his colleagues to address some of the most pressing issues facing our community - including expanded access to health clinics, recruiting and retaining doctors to work in our inner cities and underserved areas, improved access to pre-natal care and services to reduce the infant and maternal mortality rate, and ways to reduce the financial impact to hospitals like Regional One Health, previously known as The MED, that provide hundreds of millions in uncompensated care to people each year.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA)
Congressman Cohen was proud to vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. Since its passage, 20 million Americans have gained health coverage from the ACA with tens of millions more benefiting from the health care law including Memphians. With the ACA, young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' insurance plan and health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions. Memphis has seen the benefits to our public health framework as millions of dollars in federal grant funding have been invested in our community health centers. Congressman Cohen continues to strongly believe in the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and will continue to fight against the removal of health insurance for millions of Americans. Affordable health care should be a right, not a privilege. Congressman Cohen has voted more than 65 times against the repeal of the ACA, including on May 4, 2017 when he voted against the American Health Care Act, also known as "Trumpcare." He has cosponsored bills which would instead protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, including the Undo Sabotage and Expand Affordability of Health Insurance Act. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which would give America a truly universal, single-payer system similar to the less costly and more efficient systems found in Western Europe, Australia and Canada.
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Disability
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs impact the lives and health of thousands of citizens in Memphis and across the country. Congressman Cohen greatly appreciates the importance of all three of these essential programs and is committed to ensuring that these promised benefits are available to those who rely on them. These programs serve as the safety net for our nation's seniors as well as our disabled and low income citizens, and Congressman Cohen will continue to push Congress to constantly evaluate the performance of the Medicare and Medicaid programs in order to realize the programs' full potential. Congressman Cohen remains committed to ensuring that his constituents receive the benefits that they have earned after years of contribution.
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has been a leading health issue facing Congress. Congress created CHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. CHIP provides health coverage for over 9 million children in working families with parents who either can't afford insurance or hold jobs that lack health care benefits. CHIP and Medicaid together cover 39 percent of children in the U.S. It was shameful that Congress allowed CHIP funding to expire on September 30, 2017. Congressman Cohen wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Speaker Paul Ryan, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi asking for the clean and speedy reauthorization of CHIP. He was proud to vote for the six-year reauthorization of CHIP funding on January 22, 2018, as well as the additional four year extension on February 9, 2018, ensuring that CHIP will have dedicated funding for the next ten years.
Disproportionate Sharing Hospitals (DSH) Allotments
In 2015, Congressman Cohen helped negotiate a compromise with the Tennessee Congressional Delegation that will guarantee disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments totaling more than $530 million over the next 10 years to help the state's hospitals and community health centers recoup expenses incurred caring for those who cannot afford to pay. He is a cosponsor of a bill to make the Tennessee DSH allotment permanent. Tennessee is the only state in the nation that does not receive DSH allotments automatically. Congressman Cohen believes that Tennessee hospitals deserve the same level of certainty about their DSH allotments that hospitals throughout the United States have, and will continue to fighting for Tennessee's hospitals in a bipartisan fashion to bring funds that will help keep hospitals around the state open and that will help provide all Memphians and Tennesseans access to the medical care they need.
Medical Marijuana
Congressman Cohen has long supported medical marijuana laws throughout his career in public life and has worked for more rational and just policies. With cuts being made across all levels of government and in nearly every agency, it makes no sense to waste dwindling resources interfering with a system that helps ease suffering and brings in revenue that helps pay for roads and highways, for police and for firemen. Medical marijuana is an important treatment for individuals suffering from debilitating diseases—in some cases, it is the only treatment that works. It is not a good use of our limited federal resources to prevent people with diseases like AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis from seeking a little relief, compassion and dignity. Congressman Cohen introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States (CARERS) Act that would move to fix our country's failed drug policy concerning marijuana and help medical patients get the relief they need.
Mental Health
Mental health is an issue that is deeply personal for Congressman Cohen, most notably because his father was a psychiatrist who later served as superintendent at the Western State Mental Health Institute in Bolivar, Tennessee. Congressman Cohen believes that the United States needs a mental health care system that is of a high quality, while also being accessible and affordable. Mental illnesses are treatable diseases that impact millions of Americans each year, but many group health plans do not provide the same coverage for mental illnesses as they do for physical ailments. Congressman Cohen has cosponsored legislation that would ensure that mental health and addiction benefits are no more restricted or costly than medical and surgical benefits, as well as legislation to support proven initiatives and programs that provide assistance to patients without discouraging them from seeking care. Congressman Cohen believes that it is important to protect the rights of individuals requiring mental health assistance while providing treatment that is comprehensive, nondiscriminatory and protects them against abuse.
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Funding
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) serves as the world's preeminent medical research institution and our nation's best hope for finding cures, improving treatments, and gaining a better understanding of the complex causes of diseases that affect millions of Americans. It also generates high-paying jobs in the cutting-edge biomedical research industry and keeps America competitive in biomedical science. As a co-chair of the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus, Congressman Cohen is an advocate for sustained and strong federal funding of the research programs performed at the NIH. Disease is the most prominent enemy of our nation and we must do everything in our power to conquer it. While we have foreign enemies overseas that we have to defend ourselves against, it is much more likely that the average American will themselves or through a family member face a debilitating disease than an international threat. Congressman Cohen has always considered the NIH to be our nation's other Department of Defense and believes that the NIH should be funded accordingly. Congressman Cohen has consistently joined with his colleagues in the House to oppose measures that would cut funding to the NIH, as well as to support measures that would increase its funding through the federal appropriations process. In the past diseases have emerged that understandably alarmed the American public, but with proper and adequate funding we can do more to both stop the spread of and cure illnesses. Increased funding will allow our nation to be better prepared to work from a place of prevention – not reaction – when it comes to infectious diseases. Congressman Cohen will continue to push for funding for the NIH to be increased -- not slashed -- because the research conducted at the NIH helps save lives, creates jobs and benefits future generations.

As a co-chair of the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus, Congressman Cohen is an advocate for sustained and strong federal funding of the research programs performed at the NIH. Disease is the most prominent enemy of our nation and we must do everything in our power to conquer it. While we have foreign enemies overseas that we have to defend ourselves against, it is much more likely that the average American will themselves or through a family member face a debilitating disease than an international threat. Congressman Cohen has always considered the NIH to be our nation's other Department of Defense and believes that the NIH should be funded accordingly. Congressman Cohen has consistently joined with his colleagues in the House to oppose measures that would cut funding to the NIH, as well as to support measures that would increase its funding through the federal appropriations process. In the past diseases have emerged that understandably alarmed the American public, but with proper and adequate funding we can do more to both stop the spread of and cure illnesses. Increased funding will allow our nation to be better prepared to work from a place of prevention – not reaction – when it comes to infectious diseases. Congressman Cohen will continue to push for funding for the NIH to be increased -- not slashed -- because the research conducted at the NIH helps save lives, creates jobs and benefits future generations.
It is important that we sufficiently protect our citizens within our borders and keep out those that would do us harm. Homeland Security is not just protecting our borders and screening the cargo that comes through our ports. It also includes providing adequate training and equipment for our first responders – police, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel. These courageous people work on the front lines, often entering into dangerous and uncertain situations. Congressman Cohen is working hard to provide additional funds for our first responders.
Congressman Cohen strongly opposes President Trump's executive order indefinitely banning Syrian refugees from entering the United States and temporarily halting all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen executive order and originally spoke out against it on the House Floor on January 30, 2017. He believes it is unconstitutional and immoral. The United States does not - and should not - have religious tests. This hasty and unsound executive order makes the United States less safe. It will provide ISIS with additional propaganda against the United States. The order also singles out a small number of countries, but ignores others like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Egypt from which individuals have been linked to actual terror attacks inside the United States.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) Act, which would prevent the Administration from denying entry to immigrants and refugees based on race, religion, or nationality. This legislation does not weaken the existing vetting process. Everyone agrees that we should screen refugees to ensure that no one intent on doing harm is allowed into our country. That's why it currently takes up to two years for applicants to be fully screened, and Congressman Cohen continues to support this screening process. Congressman Cohen was very disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the President's travel ban on June 26, 2018.
On February 7, 2017, Congressman Cohen signed on a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General and Acting Officer for Civil Rights requesting an investigation into the Muslim Ban executive order.
Congressman Cohen voted against the against the Department of Defense Appropriations Act which includes $1.6 billion for construction of President Trump's border wall, breaking the President's promise to the American people that Mexico, and not taxpayers, would pay for it. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 27, 2017 by a vote of 235-192.
Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Election Infrastructure and Security Promotion Act which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate voting systems as critical infrastructure which would mean that election infrastructure becomes a priority within the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and prioritize cybersecurity assistance to state and local election officials, but only for those who request it. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct research to mitigate the consequences of threats to voting systems. The bill requires that the voting systems used in elections for Federal office to comply with national standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for operational security and ballot verification.
Congressman Cohen wrote a letter to President Trump on October 17, 2017 expressing disappointment in his decision to set the presidential determination for refugee admissions at 45,000 for Fiscal Year 2018, urging the President to reconsider his determination and establish a minimum refugee admission level of 110,000 for Fiscal Year 2018, and expressing concern about the proposed changes to the resettlement process to require refugees to meet an assimilation standard.
Congressman Cohen wrote a letter to Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Homeland Security Nielsen on July 10, 2018 to set the Presidential Determination for Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2019 to 110,000.
War on Terror / Protecting the Home Front
Ensuring the safety of America and our allies is a matter that Congressman Cohen takes very seriously. This includes preventing weapons and military technology from falling into the hands of international terrorist organizations and governments that support these organizations. It is imperative that any arms sales meet strict criteria that would prevent weapons from falling into the hands of those who would use them against us, our allies or for terrorism purposes anywhere in the world. Congressman Cohen believes that extreme ideologies of all kinds are a serious concern to the safety of our nation and its citizens.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act. This bipartisan bill prohibits suspected terrorists on the no-fly list from buying guns or explosives.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Reauthorization of the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act. The National Urban Search and Rescue Response System is used to locate, rescue, and provide initial medical stabilization to individuals who have been trapped in confined spaces due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and large-scale accidents and emergencies. The authorization for this crucial program lapsed in 2008, but it has continued to receive appropriated funds every year since. In fiscal year 2018, this program received $35.2 million, the year before – $38.3 million. There is a Taskforce in Memphis.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Port Security Grant Program Reauthorization Act. The National Port Security Grant Program is a key component of our national strategy to strengthen critical infrastructure against potential terrorist attacks. The authorization for this crucial program lapsed in 2013, but it has continued to receive appropriated funds every year since.
MEMPHIS – Six weeks after his initial request, Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today renewed his demand for information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies, priorities and transparency from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Congressman Cohen made the following statement:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today reintroduced the Baseball Diplomacy Act to eliminate barriers to Cuban athletes entering the U.S. on non-immigrant visas during the baseball season and then returning home when the season ends.

The letter reads in part:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, today reintroduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act, requiring the collection of pertinent information in these cases. The 1994 Crime Bill requires the Attorney General to collect information on instances of “excessive” force but the term is difficult to define. Congressman Cohen’s bill would be limited collecting records in cases of the use of deadly force.

Congressman Cohen is a strong advocate for fair housing policies and increased federal investment in affordable housing. Mindful of the Great Recession of 2008, during which Memphis and the nation suffered an unprecedented foreclosure crisis, Congressman Cohen strongly supports efforts to prevent predatory practices in the home mortgage loan industry to protect future or current homebuyers and homeowners, respectively.
Congressman Cohen introduced the Housing Accountability Act, alongside Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), which would hold property owners of low-income, federally-subsidized housing facilities accountable for poor living conditions. Working across the aisle, some of the important provisions of the Housing Accountability Act were passed by the House and Senate and signed into law, increasing the accountability of landlords managing federally subsidized housing facilities to prevent chronic, persistent issues that threaten the health and safety of tenants.
In 2015, after a long multi-year, the Congressman was pleased to announce that Memphis, among nine nationwide finalists, was awarded a $30 million federal grant from the Choice Neighborhood program to redevelop Foote Homes and bring much needed revitalization to Memphis. The Choice Neighborhoods program was an initiative of the Obama Administration that sought to transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income areas with access to economic opportunities. The program endeavored to do so through the revitalization of severely distressed public and assisted housing by leveraging and investing in well-functioning services, effective schools and education programs, public assets, public transportation and improved access to jobs.
Congressman Cohen has worked to shed light on the mismanagement of several low-income, public housing facilities in Memphis including Goodwill Village, Tulane, and the Warren Apartments. Congressman Cohen wrote to then-Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Julian Castro, to launch an investigation. Even after a change of management, persistent maintenance concerns remain at several properties which led Congressman Cohen to write to current HUD Secretary Ben Carson, demanding to know what steps the Trump Administration would be taking to bring property managers of poorly maintained public housing facilities in compliance with federal law.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) led a letter to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner on Friday urging him to reverse the cancellation of contracts and the freezing of all funding associated with the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). Congressman Cohen announced $5.2 million in GRRP funding for Wesley Stage Park in Memphis and $11.4 million for the Broadmeadow Apartments in Covington in March 2024.
Fifteen Congressional colleagues co-signed the letter.
The letter reads:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today filed a discharge petition on the House floor to force a vote on his Latonya Reeves Freedom Act. The rare parliamentary maneuver would require a vote on the measure if 218 members of Congress sign the petition. The bill currently has 222 cosponsors.
WASHINGTON -- Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today reintroduced the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act, legislation to help American families cover the cost of eliminating lead from their homes.  The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act would significantly broaden the national response to this public health challenge by providing refundable tax credits for homeowners, landlords, and tenants to remove lead from homes.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, today announced that Shelby County’s Office of Re-Entry will receive a grant of $999,101 from the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance to provide safe, affordable housing and comprehensive services to individuals upon their release from prison. The program is intended to reduce recidivism rates in Memphis and Shelby County by mitigating barriers to housing and employment.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09) today introduced the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Equity Act, which would update the current U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) CDBG funding criteria and adopt a single formula for grants based on factors reflecting current needs.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that Memphis will receive $13,592,584 and Shelby County will receive $1,594,934 in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Planning and Development Formula Funding for the current fiscal year.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is investing $17,120,000 for energy efficiency upgrades to housing developments in Covington and Memphis. The owners of Wesley Stage Park in Memphis will receive $5,280,000 and the owners of the Broadmeadow Apartments in Covington will receive $11,840,000.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), whose district includes Memphis with a child poverty rate of 32.7 percent, went to the House floor Tuesday evening to discuss income inequality and poverty and Tennessee’s failure to address it.
In his remarks, he said in part:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) will hold a press availability to celebrate the $3 million appropriation he secured for the renovation of Historic Melrose High School in Orange Mound on Monday, November 27.  Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and the city’s Housing and Community Development Director Ashley Cash will also speak and take questions.

I have the great honor of serving on the House Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over a wide range of issues including crime, civil rights and civil liberties, immigration, bankruptcy, antitrust, intellectual property, and all constitutional amendments.
I currently serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (link is external) , which handles constitutional amendments, Federal civil rights, ethics in government, medical malpractice and product liability and other issues.
Below are some of the legislation I have worked on relating to issues before the Judiciary Committee:
Protecting Civil Rights
As the Chairman on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, Congressman Cohen is working to protect civil rights as well as reform the criminal justice system to make it more fair. He has introduced several bills to improve police practices including the Police Training and Independent Review Act , which he introduced with Congressman Lacy Clay (D-MO) whose district includes Ferguson, Missouri, and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). The legislation creates an incentive for states to require independent investigation and prosecution of incidents in which police use of deadly force results in a death or injury. It also requires sensitivity training on ethnic and racial bias, cultural diversity, and interactions with the disabled, mentally ill, and new immigrants. The bill is supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Congressman Cohen has also introduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act to require states, as a condition of receipt of full Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding, to collect data in all instances in which deadly force was used and report it to the Department of Justice, and the Police Creating Accountability in Making Effective Recording Available (CAMERA) Act to establish a grant program to assist state and local law enforcement with the purchase of body cameras to be worn by police officers. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the End Racial Profiling Act to prohibit law enforcement from engaging in racial profiling, grant victims of racial profiling the right to file suit, authorize grants to collect data relating to racial profiling, and require state and local law enforcement to certify that they have eliminated any practices that permit or encourage racial profiling, and the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act . This bipartisan bill places restrictions and transparency measures on the Defense Department's program that transfers excess military equipment to local law enforcement including preventing transfers of equipment such as grenade launchers, weaponized drones and armored military vehicles that are inappropriate for local policing. Congressman Cohen is cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (H.R. 6545). The legislation authorizes grants to develop and enforce firearm surrender policies, survivor safety and legal assistance to dependent children in appropriate circumstances. It also improves services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, extends the Rape Prevention and Education grant program, expands grants to help public health officials increase capacity for early childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, expands housing protections for survivors, and expands firearms laws to prohibit persons convicted of dating violence and stalking from possessing firearms. He has also cosponsored the No Money Bail Act to eliminate the payment of money as a condition of pretrial release of criminal defendants. The Congressman is also working to help ex-offenders to reenter and become productive members of society. He introduced the Fresh Start Act to give nonviolent ex-offenders a chance to start over again. It allows ex-offenders to apply for expungement to the court where they were sentenced and allows the United States Attorney for that District to submit recommendations to the court. Applicants who are denied could reapply once every two years. Once seven years have elapsed since an offender has completed his or her sentence, expungement will be automatically granted. However, sex offenders and those who commit crimes causing a loss of over $25,000 will not be eligible for automatic expungement. The bill also encourages states to pass their own expungement laws for state offenses. States that pass a substantially similar law would receive a 5 percent increase in their Byrne funding while those that do not would lose 5 percent of their Byrne funds. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the Second Chance Reauthorization Act . This bill reauthorizes funding for programs to help inmates become productive and law abiding citizens after they are released. Programs include education, housing, job training, drug treatment and medical care. The Congressman has also cosponsored the Fair Chance Act . This "ban the box" bill prohibits federal agencies and contractors from requesting that applicants for employment disclose certain criminal activity in their history records before receiving a conditional offer. Congressman Cohen is also working to protect the right to vote and make voting fairer and more accessible. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court struck down portions of it in Shelby County v. Holder by establishing a new, nationwide coverage formula for preclearance, as well as the Voting Rights Advancement Act . This bill restores the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court struck down portions of it in Shelby County v. Holder , and makes improvements to the underlying law. This bill updates the Voting Rights Act by restoring the preclearance requirement and adds a new coverage formula that would initially include 13 states but can be adjusted over time as conditions warrant.
Congressman Cohen has introduced the Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act . This bill requires states to allow early voting for federal elections for at least two weeks prior to Election Day. It also ensures that polling locations are within walking distance of a stop on a public transportation route, sufficient voting systems, poll workers, and other election resources are provided, wait times are fair and equitable for all voters across a state, and no one is required to wait longer than one hour to cast a ballot at a polling place. It also allows civil money penalties, intervention by aggrieved parties, and private actions to address violations. He is also a cosponsor of the Voter Empowerment Act . The bill ensures access to online voter registration and same day registration, ensures that all provisional ballots are counted, provides for informed, reliable poll workers, creates national voter hotline, and ensures votes are counted correctly.
Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Automatic Voter Registration Act to require states to automatically register anyone who provides identifying information to the state's department of motor vehicles, as well the America Votes Act which allows voters to provide a sworn, written statement attesting to their identification as a means by which to meet voter identification requirements, and the Weekend Voting Act to move election day to a weekend. To help protect election integrity, the Congressman has cosponsored the Campaign Sunlight Act which requires sponsors of political advertisements to make the contents and sources of information used in their ads available for public inspection online. He is also a cosponsor of the Election Vendor Security Act to require election vendors to be owned and controlled by a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and to disclose whether they are using any foreign-made parts in their products, and the Election Integrity Act to limit the purchase of any new voting systems that do not provide durable voter-verified paper ballots, establish protocols for when there is a voting system failure, prohibit voting systems responsible for tabulating votes from being insecurely connected to the internet, and call for security standards for voting systems used in federal elections. The bill also establishes guidelines for the publication of voter purge lists and a process by which individuals can challenge their placement on a purge list, and requires a mandatory response by the Attorney General for allegations of voter suppression and intimidation. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Disclosure of Information on Spending Campaigns Leads to Open and Secure Elections (DISCLOSE) Act . This bill improves disclosure of campaign-related spending by corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision by requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups to report to the Federal Elections Commission within 24 hours of making a $10,000 campaign expenditure or financial transfer to other groups for campaign activity, requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups stand by their advertising by saying they "approve this message," requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups to disclose their campaign-related spending to their shareholders and organization members, and requiring all federally registered lobbyists to disclose their political expenditures. Fighting Crime and Seeking Justice
Congressman Cohen offered an amendment to a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations package to increase funding by $4 million for programs to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits. The amendment was adopted by the House of Representatives on September 12, 2017, and the package containing it was approved the House of Representatives on September 14, 2017. Ultimately, $2.5 million of this increase was enacted into law in the final package adopted in 2018. The amendment built upon similar amendments offered by Congressman Cohen that have also been enacted into law. In 2014, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by $5 million. In 2015, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by an additional $4 million. Including the increase prompted by Congressman Cohen's most recent amendment, the program has seen an overall increase from $36 million to $47.5 million since 2014 – a nearly 32% increase. To help reduce gun violence, Congressman Cohen has cosponsored the Assault Weapons Ban which prohibits the sale, transfer, production, and importation of: semi-automatic rifles and pistols with a military-style feature that can accept a detachable magazine, semi-automatic rifles with a fixed magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds, semi-automatic shotguns with a military-style feature, any ammunition feeding device that can hold more than 10 rounds, and 205 specifically-named and listed firearms. He has also cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act which prohibits the sale of bump stocks, which modify semi-automatic rifles to replicate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. Bump stocks were added to weapons used by the Mandalay Bay Hotel shooter. This legislation bans the possession of any fire arms accessory that accelerates the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Raise the Age Act to prohibit the licensing, selling or delivering certain semiautomatic weapons to persons under 21 years of age. The bill allows for exceptions for individuals who are members of the Armed Forces on active duty, or a full-time government employee whose official duties requires the carrying of a firearm. He is also a cosponsor of the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act to require operators of gun shows to undergo a background check to ensure that they are at least 21 years old, not prohibited from transporting or shipping guns, have registered as a gun show operator, have not lied as a part of the registration process or concealed information from the registry, and have verified the identity of every vendor who will be participating an upcoming gun show, and the Background Check Completion Act to close the loophole that allowed the shooter in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina to obtain a gun. The Brady Act mandates criminal background checks for all gun sales at licensed firearm dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). While the vast majority of checks are processed within minutes, if NICS has not completed its background check after three days, the dealer is currently allowed to proceed with the sale. The bill stops the sales of firearms until the background check is completed. Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act to require the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report the number of guns transferred as a result of a failure to complete a background check within three days, as well as what occurred after it was discovered that someone received a gun who was ineligible to have received it, a cosponsor of a resolution to establish a Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention , and a cosponsor of the Gun Violence Research Act to give the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the authority to research the causes injuries due to gun violence as well as ways to prevent them. It will also improve the National Violent Death Reporting System and enable health care providers to report threats of violence. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the effects of gun violence on mental health in minority communities. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Buyback our Safety Act to authorize $15 million over 5 years to establish a new matching grant at the Department of Justice to bolster local gun buyback initiatives, and the End Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act to require that all 50 states provide information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on individuals who are committed to a mental institution or who express a threat of violence to a mental health professional. To reduce drunk driving deaths, Congressman Cohen introduced the DUI Reporting Act. This bipartisan bill would requires driving under the influence (DUI) arrests to be reported to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database as a condition of receipt of full Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant funding, to stop repeat DUI offenders from being mistakenly charged as "first-time" offenders. Judicial Nominations
Congressman Cohen recommended U.S. Attorney Ed Stanton to President Barack Obama for nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The president nominated Stanton, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination on October 29, 2015. Stanton's nomination is now awaiting consideration before the full Senate. Other Legislative Highlights:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, today said Congress has surrendered its Constitutional rights under Article One, including the power of the purse, to the Trump Administration and abandoned its duty to be a check on the Executive Branch at a Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement hearing on sanctuary jurisdictions.
In his statement, he said in part:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and its Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government, today discussed President Trump’s efforts to upend the judicial system at a hearing entitled “Judicial Overreach and Constitutional Limits on the Federal Courts.” Trump’s efforts include extorting law firms, damaging independent agencies, and proposing to end national injunctive relief, and impeaching judges who make rulings with which he disagrees.

Issues
I have the great honor of serving on the House Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over a wide range of issues including crime, civil rights and civil liberties, immigration, bankruptcy, antitrust, intellectual property, and all constitutional amendments. I currently serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (link is external) , which handles constitutional amendments, Federal civil rights, ethics in government, medical malpractice and product liability and other issues. Below are some of the legislation I have worked on relating to issues before the Judiciary Committee: Protecting Civil Rights As the Chairman on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, Congressman Cohen is working to protect civil rights as well as reform the criminal justice system to make it more fair. He has introduced several bills to improve police practices including the Police Training and Independent Review Act , which he introduced with Congressman Lacy Clay (D-MO) whose district includes Ferguson, Missouri, and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). The legislation creates an incentive for states to require independent investigation and prosecution of incidents in which police use of deadly force results in a death or injury. It also requires sensitivity training on ethnic and racial bias, cultural diversity, and interactions with the disabled, mentally ill, and new immigrants. The bill is supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Congressman Cohen has also introduced the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act to require states, as a condition of receipt of full Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding, to collect data in all instances in which deadly force was used and report it to the Department of Justice, and the Police Creating Accountability in Making Effective Recording Available (CAMERA) Act to establish a grant program to assist state and local law enforcement with the purchase of body cameras to be worn by police officers. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the End Racial Profiling Act to prohibit law enforcement from engaging in racial profiling, grant victims of racial profiling the right to file suit, authorize grants to collect data relating to racial profiling, and require state and local law enforcement to certify that they have eliminated any practices that permit or encourage racial profiling, and the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act . This bipartisan bill places restrictions and transparency measures on the Defense Department's program that transfers excess military equipment to local law enforcement including preventing transfers of equipment such as grenade launchers, weaponized drones and armored military vehicles that are inappropriate for local policing. Congressman Cohen is cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (H.R. 6545). The legislation authorizes grants to develop and enforce firearm surrender policies, survivor safety and legal assistance to dependent children in appropriate circumstances. It also improves services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, extends the Rape Prevention and Education grant program, expands grants to help public health officials increase capacity for early childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, expands housing protections for survivors, and expands firearms laws to prohibit persons convicted of dating violence and stalking from possessing firearms. He has also cosponsored the No Money Bail Act to eliminate the payment of money as a condition of pretrial release of criminal defendants. The Congressman is also working to help ex-offenders to reenter and become productive members of society. He introduced the Fresh Start Act to give nonviolent ex-offenders a chance to start over again. It allows ex-offenders to apply for expungement to the court where they were sentenced and allows the United States Attorney for that District to submit recommendations to the court. Applicants who are denied could reapply once every two years. Once seven years have elapsed since an offender has completed his or her sentence, expungement will be automatically granted. However, sex offenders and those who commit crimes causing a loss of over $25,000 will not be eligible for automatic expungement. The bill also encourages states to pass their own expungement laws for state offenses. States that pass a substantially similar law would receive a 5 percent increase in their Byrne funding while those that do not would lose 5 percent of their Byrne funds. Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the Second Chance Reauthorization Act . This bill reauthorizes funding for programs to help inmates become productive and law abiding citizens after they are released. Programs include education, housing, job training, drug treatment and medical care. The Congressman has also cosponsored the Fair Chance Act . This "ban the box" bill prohibits federal agencies and contractors from requesting that applicants for employment disclose certain criminal activity in their history records before receiving a conditional offer. Congressman Cohen is also working to protect the right to vote and make voting fairer and more accessible. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court struck down portions of it in Shelby County v. Holder by establishing a new, nationwide coverage formula for preclearance, as well as the Voting Rights Advancement Act . This bill restores the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court struck down portions of it in Shelby County v. Holder , and makes improvements to the underlying law. This bill updates the Voting Rights Act by restoring the preclearance requirement and adds a new coverage formula that would initially include 13 states but can be adjusted over time as conditions warrant. Congressman Cohen has introduced the Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act . This bill requires states to allow early voting for federal elections for at least two weeks prior to Election Day. It also ensures that polling locations are within walking distance of a stop on a public transportation route, sufficient voting systems, poll workers, and other election resources are provided, wait times are fair and equitable for all voters across a state, and no one is required to wait longer than one hour to cast a ballot at a polling place. It also allows civil money penalties, intervention by aggrieved parties, and private actions to address violations. He is also a cosponsor of the Voter Empowerment Act . The bill ensures access to online voter registration and same day registration, ensures that all provisional ballots are counted, provides for informed, reliable poll workers, creates national voter hotline, and ensures votes are counted correctly. Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Automatic Voter Registration Act to require states to automatically register anyone who provides identifying information to the state's department of motor vehicles, as well the America Votes Act which allows voters to provide a sworn, written statement attesting to their identification as a means by which to meet voter identification requirements, and the Weekend Voting Act to move election day to a weekend. To help protect election integrity, the Congressman has cosponsored the Campaign Sunlight Act which requires sponsors of political advertisements to make the contents and sources of information used in their ads available for public inspection online. He is also a cosponsor of the Election Vendor Security Act to require election vendors to be owned and controlled by a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and to disclose whether they are using any foreign-made parts in their products, and the Election Integrity Act to limit the purchase of any new voting systems that do not provide durable voter-verified paper ballots, establish protocols for when there is a voting system failure, prohibit voting systems responsible for tabulating votes from being insecurely connected to the internet, and call for security standards for voting systems used in federal elections. The bill also establishes guidelines for the publication of voter purge lists and a process by which individuals can challenge their placement on a purge list, and requires a mandatory response by the Attorney General for allegations of voter suppression and intimidation. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Disclosure of Information on Spending Campaigns Leads to Open and Secure Elections (DISCLOSE) Act . This bill improves disclosure of campaign-related spending by corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision by requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups to report to the Federal Elections Commission within 24 hours of making a $10,000 campaign expenditure or financial transfer to other groups for campaign activity, requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups stand by their advertising by saying they "approve this message," requiring corporations, Super PACs and other outside groups to disclose their campaign-related spending to their shareholders and organization members, and requiring all federally registered lobbyists to disclose their political expenditures. Fighting Crime and Seeking Justice Congressman Cohen offered an amendment to a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations package to increase funding by $4 million for programs to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits. The amendment was adopted by the House of Representatives on September 12, 2017, and the package containing it was approved the House of Representatives on September 14, 2017. Ultimately, $2.5 million of this increase was enacted into law in the final package adopted in 2018. The amendment built upon similar amendments offered by Congressman Cohen that have also been enacted into law. In 2014, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by $5 million. In 2015, an amendment by Congressman Cohen increased funding by an additional $4 million. Including the increase prompted by Congressman Cohen's most recent amendment, the program has seen an overall increase from $36 million to $47.5 million since 2014 – a nearly 32% increase. To help reduce gun violence, Congressman Cohen has cosponsored the Assault Weapons Ban which prohibits the sale, transfer, production, and importation of: semi-automatic rifles and pistols with a military-style feature that can accept a detachable magazine, semi-automatic rifles with a fixed magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds, semi-automatic shotguns with a military-style feature, any ammunition feeding device that can hold more than 10 rounds, and 205 specifically-named and listed firearms. He has also cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act which prohibits the sale of bump stocks, which modify semi-automatic rifles to replicate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. Bump stocks were added to weapons used by the Mandalay Bay Hotel shooter. This legislation bans the possession of any fire arms accessory that accelerates the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle. The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Raise the Age Act to prohibit the licensing, selling or delivering certain semiautomatic weapons to persons under 21 years of age. The bill allows for exceptions for individuals who are members of the Armed Forces on active duty, or a full-time government employee whose official duties requires the carrying of a firearm. He is also a cosponsor of the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act to require operators of gun shows to undergo a background check to ensure that they are at least 21 years old, not prohibited from transporting or shipping guns, have registered as a gun show operator, have not lied as a part of the registration process or concealed information from the registry, and have verified the identity of every vendor who will be participating an upcoming gun show, and the Background Check Completion Act to close the loophole that allowed the shooter in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina to obtain a gun. The Brady Act mandates criminal background checks for all gun sales at licensed firearm dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). While the vast majority of checks are processed within minutes, if NICS has not completed its background check after three days, the dealer is currently allowed to proceed with the sale. The bill stops the sales of firearms until the background check is completed. Congressman Cohen is a cosponsor of the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act to require the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report the number of guns transferred as a result of a failure to complete a background check within three days, as well as what occurred after it was discovered that someone received a gun who was ineligible to have received it, a cosponsor of a resolution to establish a Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention , and a cosponsor of the Gun Violence Research Act to give the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the authority to research the causes injuries due to gun violence as well as ways to prevent them. It will also improve the National Violent Death Reporting System and enable health care providers to report threats of violence. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the effects of gun violence on mental health in minority communities. Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of the Buyback our Safety Act to authorize $15 million over 5 years to establish a new matching grant at the Department of Justice to bolster local gun buyback initiatives, and the End Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act to require that all 50 states provide information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on individuals who are committed to a mental institution or who express a threat of violence to a mental health professional. To reduce drunk driving deaths, Congressman Cohen introduced the DUI Reporting Act. This bipartisan bill would requires driving under the influence (DUI) arrests to be reported to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database as a condition of receipt of full Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant funding, to stop repeat DUI offenders from being mistakenly charged as "first-time" offenders. Judicial Nominations Congressman Cohen recommended U.S. Attorney Ed Stanton to President Barack Obama for nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The president nominated Stanton, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination on October 29, 2015. Stanton's nomination is now awaiting consideration before the full Senate. Other Legislative Highlights: Key legislation I authored to stop "libel tourism" -- a practice by which plaintiffs seek judgments from foreign courts against American authors and publishers for making allegedly defamatory statements -- was considered in the Judiciary Committee before it was signed into law by President Obama. This phenomenon threatens to undermine our nation's core free speech principles, as embodied in the First Amendment. My law will prohibit U.S. courts from recognizing or enforcing foreign defamation judgments that do not comport with the First Amendment. The "Justice Integrity Act" ( H.R. 1771 (link is external) ) would create a pilot program to examine racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system and develop solutions to this injustice. Over the past 30 years while working directly with the people of Memphis and the 9th District, I have spoken to many people in the African-American community regarding their deep misgivings about the fairness of the criminal justice system. I believe the Justice Integrity Act can begin the process of mending fences between law enforcement and minorities and increasing public confidence in the justice system. H.R. 2878 (link is external) would create a new visa category for temporary admissions to the United States solely for the purpose of receiving medical treatment for a serious or life-threatening condition. The new visa category would allow two immediate family members of the patient to accompany him or her. It would also provide a work authorization for any parent who accompanies his or her child under the new visa category if the child's medical treatment will last six months or longer. This legislation is a humane response to a global need for access to the top-quality medical care that American hospitals provide. The "Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act of 2010" ( H.R. 2028 (link is external) ) would amend the federal bankruptcy code to treat privately issued student loans equally with other types of private debt. This would allow them to be discharged in bankruptcy. There is no reason that private student loan lenders should receive special protection under the bankruptcy system. The bankruptcy system should act as a safety net that allows people to pursue an education with the assurance that, should their finances come under strain by layoffs, accidents, or other unforeseen life events, they will be protected. The "Byrne/JAG Program Accountability Act" ( H.R. 1913 (link is external) ) would require states and localities that receive federal law enforcement funding to implement policies and practices to identify and reduce racial and ethnic disparities within their criminal justice systems. Racial and ethnic disparities have engendered a crisis of public trust in the integrity of the criminal justice system and fueled perceptions of community bias. This bill would be a critical step toward identifying and eliminating these disparities. The "Fresh Start Act" ( H.R. 2449 (link is external) ) would enable non-violent federal offenders who have served their time and lived a clean life ever since to have their convictions expunged from their records. To be eligible for expungement, an offender may not have committed any other state or federal offense, whether violent or non-violent, and must have served their full sentence. This bill would allow people who made a mistake earlier in life, and have paid their debt to society, to wipe the slate clean and lead productive lives.
As a member of Congress, I have supported federal funding for programs like the National Science Foundation (NSF), which has led to several innovations in engineering and technology. I will continue to support legislation that will increase funding for technological and scientific research, especially in the Memphis medical community.
As a long-time supporter of STEM education programs, I know that engineering and computer science are increasingly important subjects for all of our children to study. In Congress, I have cosponsored several bills that would improve funding and accessibility to STEM programs across the country, including legislation that created grants for encouraging underrepresented minority or low-income students to pursue STEM careers.
In Fall 2016, I voted for the budget agreement for Fiscal Year 2017 which provides funding for essential government programs including National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The bill provided $19.65 billion to NASA, which was $600 million more than the agency's original request.
As a member of Congress, I will continue to encourage progress in science and technology for the American people.

Small businesses are the heart of the American economy. Our country's small businesses employ half of the nation's private sector workforce and create a large portion of America's new jobs. It is critical that small businesses play a significant role in our efforts to restore America's economic strength and the growth of Memphis.
Growing small businesses – specifically businesses owned by minorities and women entrepreneurs - has been a recent topic in Memphis. Opening new doors for small businesses here in the United States and internationally is essential. For Memphis businesses to grow, we must ensure they are represented in the federal government's procurement process. One of the largest customers of goods and services is the federal government, and last year small businesses in the U.S. received nearly 1.8 million contracts totaling almost $90 million.
In an effort to ensure that small businesses in Memphis have the information that they need, I have for several years hosted a Federal Procurement Fair to help small business owners who want to do business with the U.S. government. The Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration and other federal agencies attend to help explain the federal contracting process and the basic requirements of engaging in business with the federal government.
Expanding the American workforce and supporting small businesses is an economic imperative. As we continue with that work, it is important for the public and private sectors to work together. I am committed to playing my part to support and empower hardworking American families, protect jobs and support small business growth in the Memphis area.

In an effort to ensure that small businesses in Memphis have the information that they need, I have for several years hosted a Federal Procurement Fair to help small business owners who want to do business with the U.S. government. The Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration and other federal agencies attend to help explain the federal contracting process and the basic requirements of engaging in business with the federal government. Expanding the American workforce and supporting small businesses is an economic imperative. As we continue with that work, it is important for the public and private sectors to work together. I am committed to playing my part to support and empower hardworking American families, protect jobs and support small business growth in the Memphis area.
I am proud to have the honor of representing Memphis, the transportation capitol of the United States and the world, on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. When it comes to transportation assets, no place in the world can rival Memphis. Memphis has the busiest cargo airport in the country, three interstates, five Class I railroads, and the fourth largest inland port in the United States. Transportation is the economic engine of Memphis, and I am committed to working to ensure that it remains the number one transportation infrastructure town in America.
The number one priority and issue for me and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is the passage of the next surface transportation authorization legislation.
Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the transportation system is that the cost of needed maintenance of existing surface transportation infrastructure assets continues to increase. As a result, the quality of our transportation system is deteriorating. Recent studies conducted by the Department of Transportation show that -
These deficiencies indicate a clear need to immediately invest in our infrastructure and services.
As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am currently working with Congressional leaders to provide authorization funding for highway and infrastructure projects of importance to the city of Memphis. Investment in public transit, highways, bridges, commuter and freight rail as well as various transit hubs, including Memphis International Airport, plays a vital role in furthering development in our community. During the 111 th Congress, I helped secure more than $112 million in transportation and infrastructural investment through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, appropriations bills, and other federal grant programs. Some examples of transportation projects include:
FedEx
From my position on the committee, I have fought hard to maintain the viability of FedEx and will continue to do so as your representative. Federal Express is the world's largest express transportation company and has made Memphis International Airport the largest cargo operation of any airport in the world, providing fast and reliable services for more than 2.8 million items to over 220 countries each working day.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
In order to rebuild our weakening economy, investments in our infrastructure will put Tennesseans immediately to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and will also enable the creation of a stronger and more efficient infrastructure for the 21st century economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act includes $701,516,776 in Transportation and Infrastructure Investment for the State of Tennessee:
Transportation Legislation
I was selected to serve as a member of a House-Senate conference committee during the 114th Congress to finalize the first multi-year highway bill in a decade: the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) (H.R. 22). The bill was signed into law by President Obama on December 4, 2015. Key features of the law include:
During the 111 th Congress, I have introduced several pieces of legislation that will improve the transportation infrastructure in Memphis, create thousands of jobs, and make the city more economically competitive.
H.R. 4287 (link is external) - Enhancing Livability for All Americans Act of 200 9
This groundbreaking legislation creates an Office of Livability within the Department of Transportation's Office of the Secretary. This idea has generated significant support throughout government and was incorporated into President's Obama 2011 Budget and will, more than likely, be created this year. With its strategic location in the Office of the Secretary, the Office of Livability will yield significant power and be responsible for implementing livability policies throughout the Department. More than simply a policy shop, the office is also tasked with working with communities to enhance livability on a local level. This community engagement will take place in two realms:
H.R. 5236 (link is external) - Aerotropolis Act of 2010
This legislation will amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to ensure that projects that assist in the establishment of aerotropolis transportation systems are eligible to receive funds under the Projects of National and Regional Significance Program.
Currently, aerotropolis transportation systems are developing in cities across the United States like Memphis and Detroit, but these cities are not able to generate sufficient funding for these complex, intermodal networks. This legislation has the potential to provide tens of millions of dollars in much needed funding for essential projects in our aerotropolis transportation system such as the new multimodal bridge over the Mississippi River, the completion of I-69, and the connection of I-22 through Lamar Avenue to I-240.
In response to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, I introduced this critical legislation, and the concept has been incorporated into the House of Representatives oil spill response legislation. This legislation would allow only American flagged vessels to engage in drilling activities in American coastal waters. Doing so will ensure that drilling in American waters is performed with a high level of safety and oversight.
As a Marshall Islands flagged vessel, the Deepwater Horizon was subject to a safety examination that took between four and eight hours and was performed by a private entity that had been paid for by the vessel owner - a significant conflict of interest. This inspection pales in comparison to those undertaken by U.S. flagged vessels which are performed by the Coast Guard and take two to three weeks. By ensuring that in the future all vessels drilling for oil in U.S. coastal waters are American flagged vessels and meet American safety standards, this legislation will help avert future monumental tragedies such as the Deepwater Horizon.
This legislation directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to establish a grant program to improve the ability of trauma center hospitals and airports to withstand earthquakes. These grants will be directed towards facilities located in seismically hazardous areas that have the greatest need for seismic retrofitting and will be the most critical following a catastrophic earthquake. If enacted, this legislation would enable the MED and Memphis International Airport to apply for funding to seismically retrofit their facilities.
This resolution creates a National Streetscaping Week which recognizes the work being done in rural and urban areas throughout the United States to become more physically and socially desirable places to live, work, and visit. At the heart of this objective is the desire to create communities that are attractive, safe, bicycle and pedestrian friendly, and environmentally sustainable. Development of such communities will improve the quality of life for all citizens and foster economic development.

As a result, the quality of our transportation system is deteriorating. Recent studies conducted by the Department of Transportation show that - Almost 61,000 miles, 37 percent, of all lane miles on the National Highway System (NHS) are in poor or fair condition. More than 146,000 bridges - almost one of every four bridges in the United States - are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. More than 32,500 public transit buses and vans in urban areas have exceeded their useful life. Congestion is crippling our major cities and even our small towns, at a cost of more than $87 billion a year, causing hardship for drivers and increasing costs and inefficiencies for America's businesses. Accidents and traffic delays cost Americans more than $365 billion a year - $1 billion a day - or $1,200 for every man, woman, and child in the nation.

A provision championed by Congressman Cohen to make transit-oriented development projects eligible for financing under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA). Transit-oriented development includes housing in varying income ranges, jobs, improved environment for pedestrians and bicyclists, within a short distance of a transit stop. $3.7 billion for bus transit programs – a 75 percent increase over current funding levels.

The bravery and devotion veterans have shown throughout our history have helped build this great country, and each of us owes them—and their families—a debt of gratitude.
Congressman Cohen believes the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that veterans receive all of the benefits they have earned.
In furtherance of this, Congressman Cohen continues to work with the Memphis VA Medical Center (VAMC) to ensure that our veterans are receiving both appropriate and excellent care at the Memphis VA. Congressman Cohen has also introduced the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act . This bill reauthorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor's Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP), which provided up to 12 months of training assistance to nearly 76,000 eligible unemployed veterans between July 2012 when it rolled out and March 2014 when it expired. The bill also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to award grants to hire veterans as firefighters and law enforcement officers. The legislation is supported by the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans and the Military Officers Association of America.
The Congressman is a cosponsor of the Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act which provides initial mental health assessments and urgent mental health care services to veterans at risk of suicide or harming others, as well as the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act . This bipartisan bill expands the eligibility for the Department of Veterans Affairss family caregiver program to include families of veterans who were seriously injured or became ill prior to September 11, 2001.
Congressman Cohen has cosponsored the Reduce Unemployment for Veterans of All Ages Act to lift the arbitrary 12-year limit to qualify for the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Program, a program to help veterans with service-connected disabilities obtain and keep meaningful employment and achieve maximum independence through job training, employment accommodations, resume development and job seeking skills coaching.
Congressman Cohen is also a cosponsor of a bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish dental care in the same manner as any other medical service.
The Congressman Cohen has also cosponsored the Medical Cannabis Research Act to increases the number of manufactures registered under the Controlled Substances Act to manufacture cannabis for legitimate research purposes and authorizes health care providers of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide recommendations to veterans regarding participation in federally-approved cannabis clinical trials, and the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act to authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to conduct and support research on the efficacy and safety of certain forms of cannabis and cannabis delivery for veterans enrolled in the VA health care system diagnosed with conditions such as chronic pain or post-traumatic stress disorder.

There are some in Congress who want to repeal the last 50 years’ worth of advances in reproductive rights for women, whether it’s through legislation or by cutting funding for vital women’s health services such as Planned Parenthood. I will continue to stand with women and make sure that their right to reproductive choice is protected.
I offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to increase funding by $4 million for programs to reduce the backlog of rape kits at law enforcement agencies. The House of Representatives passed the amendment, and it later passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Obama on 12/18/15.
Additionally, I have cosponsored many pieces of legislation regarding victims of sexual assault and domestic violence including the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, the Domestic Violence Safety Plan Grant Program Act of 2015, and the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act. These bills would make it a right for sexual assault survivors to have a rape kit preserved for as long as an assailant could be prosecuted under the law, establish a grant program to promote and teach relatives, friends, and co-workers how to combat domestic violence, and create an incentive for states to prohibit rapists from seeking custody of children conceived through rape.
Equality in the workplace is very important to me. I cosponsored of the Paycheck Fairness Act to strengthen the Equal Pay Act by providing effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work and protecting employees from retaliation for sharing salary information with their coworkers. I also cosponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act requiring employers to make reasonable, low-cost, non-disruptive accommodations to employees who have limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer.
Access to safe and affordable healthcare is a crucial issue for women. I am a cosponsor of the Affordability is Access Act. This bill clarifies that if the Food and Drug Administration approves an over-the-counter oral contraception, that insurance companies would still be required to cover it without a prescription.
In addition, I am a cosponsor of the Fund Essential Menstruation (FEM) Products Act. This bill allows feminine hygiene products to be purchased with funds from a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account.
In June 2014, I wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell to encourage the Department to ensure that women have access to breast feeding services. Specifically, he called on the Department to:
Take whatever further action may be necessary to ensure that women receive the breastfeeding benefits guaranteed by law
Ensure that women have access to breastfeeding equipment and lactation counseling.
Ensure that Qualified Health Plans in states that use federal certification are fully compliant with the lactation services and supplies requirement;
Encourage states to enforce the ACA’s lactation services and supplies requirement;
Educate insurers about their obligation to make breastfeeding supports available without cost-sharing, including through out-of-network providers when the plan has not established a network of lactation providers;
Engage with key stakeholders to reexamine coverage standards, such as the public facing materials that allow plans to provide coverage for a manual breast pump, and develop new guidance that ensures the benefit actually meets women’s needs; and
Increase consumer education and awareness about the benefits of the ACA, including breastfeeding coverage, so more women can access these important benefits and can appeal insurance company decisions if their plan does not comply with the law.
I am a cosponsor of the Women Veterans Access to Quality Care Act of 2015 to ensure that our female veterans are taken care of both at home and oversea. This bipartisan bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish standards that require the characteristics necessary to meet the gender-specific health care needs of veterans, including privacy, safety, and dignity, to integrate such standards into its prioritization and methodology.
WASHINGTON -- – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09) and Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland today reintroduced the Nationally Enhancing the Wellbeing of Babies through Outreach and Research Now (NEWBORN) Act to help address America's unacceptably high infant mortality rate with concrete solutions. If enacted, the measure would create infant mortality-focused pilot programs in the highest-risk areas of the country to help the populations most vulnerable to this devastating crisis.
Congressman Cohen made the following statement:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9), a longtime advocate for maternal and prenatal care initiatives, today announced that Le Bonheur Community Health and Well-Being’s Delta Region Maternal Care Coordination Program will receive a $450,000 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration.
Congressman Cohen made the following statement:
Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion laws and access to care vary substantially from state to state. Tennessee lawmakers have taken steps to restrict abortion rights and access during that time.
As we face an unprecedented reproductive health care crisis nationwide, I recognize that abortion care is health care. Reproductive rights are human rights, and all Tennesseans deserve the freedom to make their own medical decisions – including about abortion.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today applauded the unanimous ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court that keeps access to the widely used abortion medication mifepristone legal. The court ruled that the challenging antiabortion doctors did not have standing to pursue the case.
Congressman Cohen made the following statement:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the Shelby County and the Shelby County Health Care Corporation (Regional One) will receive $2,016,498 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy Start Initiative designed to eliminate disparities in perinatal health for expecting mothers and those who have just given birth. The program focuses on communities with infant mortality rates 1.5 times the national average.
MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today announced that the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) will receive a $475,675 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study “Candidalysin: a key mediator of Candida vaginitis immunopathology.”
Congressman Cohen made the following statement:

These bills would make it a right for sexual assault survivors to have a rape kit preserved for as long as an assailant could be prosecuted under the law, establish a grant program to promote and teach relatives, friends, and co-workers how to combat domestic violence, and create an incentive for states to prohibit rapists from seeking custody of children conceived through rape. Equality in the workplace is very important to me. I cosponsored of the Paycheck Fairness Act to strengthen the Equal Pay Act by providing effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work and protecting employees from retaliation for sharing salary information with their coworkers. I also cosponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act requiring employers to make reasonable, low-cost, non-disruptive accommodations to employees who have limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Access to safe and affordable healthcare is a crucial issue for women. I am a cosponsor of the Affordability is Access Act. This bill clarifies that if the Food and Drug Administration approves an over-the-counter oral contraception, that insurance companies would still be required to cover it without a prescription. In addition, I am a cosponsor of the Fund Essential Menstruation (FEM) Products Act. This bill allows feminine hygiene products to be purchased with funds from a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account. In June 2014, I wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell to encourage the Department to ensure that women have access to breast feeding services. Specifically, he called on the Department to: Take whatever further action may be necessary to ensure that women receive the breastfeeding benefits guaranteed by law Ensure that women have access to breastfeeding equipment and lactation counseling. Ensure that Qualified Health Plans in states that use federal certification are fully compliant with the lactation services and supplies requirement; Encourage states to enforce the ACA’s lactation services and supplies requirement; Educate insurers about their obligation to make breastfeeding supports available without cost-sharing, including through out-of-network providers when the plan has not established a network of lactation providers; Engage with key stakeholders to reexamine coverage standards, such as the public facing materials that allow plans to provide coverage for a manual breast pump, and develop new guidance that ensures the benefit actually meets women’s needs; and Increase consumer education and awareness about the benefits of the ACA, including breastfeeding coverage, so more women can access these important benefits and can appeal insurance company decisions if their plan does not comply with the law. I am a cosponsor of the Women Veterans Access to Quality Care Act of 2015 to ensure that our female veterans are taken care of both at home and oversea. This bipartisan bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish standards that require the characteristics necessary to meet the gender-specific health care needs of veterans, including privacy, safety, and dignity, to integrate such standards into its prioritization and methodology.

WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today condemned a Trump Administration proposal to cap facilities and administrative cost reimbursements to 15 percent of total research project costs on National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant awards to biomedical research institutions.

The proposed reduction would result in a roughly $250 million annual loss to institutions in the state.
WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today went to the House floor to question why the House is voting on a bill to require Congressional approval for a president to ban hydraulic fracking but not questioning President Trump’s violations of Congressional authorities under Article One of the Constitution, such as by cutting budgets, impounding funds and closing agencies.

Dear Friend,
This week, I returned to Washington and called attention to the many provisions of the Project 2025 GOP blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term that are being implemented in the chaotic frenzy of his first two months in office. I also spoke from the House floor and then voted against a disastrous Republican budget resolution, introduced a bill to prohibit Trump – or any future president – from holding a military parade for his birthday, watched Trump whipsaw the financial markets with his erratic tariff announcements, touted the major improvements made at the Memphis International Airport by federal infrastructure investments, introduced a bill to help protect debtors from unscrupulous collectors, visited with and congratulated our Congressional App Challenge winners, reminded constituents who want to fly after May 7 to get a Real ID, announced significant federal grants to Memphis Health Center and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, invited talented high school artists to participate in the Congressional Art Competition, and offered a baseball-themed Friday Flashback, a Bill Day cartoon, and a health tip. Keep reading and follow me on Bluesky (link is external) , Facebook (link is external) and Instagram (link is external) to see what I am doing as it happens.

Highlighting Devastating Project 2025 Agenda Being Enacted by Trump-Musk
This week, I pointed out that Project 2025, the GOP blueprint for a second Trump Administration that Trump claimed to know nothing about while he was campaigning last year, is being rapidly implemented by Trump-Musk-DOGE. At a Highways and Transit Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday (link is external) , I noted that Project 2025 proposed ending federal support for public transit, which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on it. Trump-Musk are already implementing a variety of Project 2025 proposals, from cuts to the Social Security workforce so it won’t work for beneficiaries, to setting the groundwork for cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, to the elimination of expertise at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) so weather forecasting can be privatized and at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while exempting polluters from the Clean Air Act. They are stripping the Department of Education to the bone and furloughing thousands from other departments and agencies Congress created that they claim are bloated, inefficient, or unneeded. No one voted for this destruction of a working federal government, but many will suffer the consequences unless the public expresses its discontent so that we can swiftly reverse it. See my speech during a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on immigration in which I said Congress has surrendered its Constitutional prerogatives to Trump here (link is external) .
Voting Against a Drastic Republican Budget Plan
On Wednesday night, I participated in the House floor debate on the Republican-sponsored budget resolution that proposes huge reductions in spending, likely on social safety net programs. I called it what it is — a tax cut giveaway for billionaires, paid for by hardworking Americans.  When Republicans couldn’t pass the measure Wednesday night, they tried again Thursday morning and, unfortunately, it passed 216 to 214. See my release and my floor speech here (link is external) .
Introducing the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act
On Wednesday, I introduced the Halting All Parades for Presidents’ Yearly Birthdays; It Risks Taxpayer Harm, Damages, And Your (HAPPY BIRTHDAY) Budget Act. The measure, drafted after press accounts of White House plans to hold a parade from the Pentagon to the White House on Donald Trump’s 79 th birthday on June 14, would prohibit enacting such a plan and any future presidential birthday parades going forward. The measure notes that a proposed $92 million parade planned during the first Trump administration was abandoned and encourages Trump to consider alternatives to fighter jet flyovers for his birthday, including birthday cake, a round of golf or a bingo night. See my release on the measure here (link is external) .
Watching Trump Disrupt Markets with Erratic Tariff Announcements and Reversals
Trillions of dollars were needlessly erased from 401(K) retirement accounts and savings plans by this irresponsibly erratic President’s threats to impose huge tariffs on our trading partners and then reversing course on most of them on Wednesday for 90 days. This is no way to run economic or trade policy, and the uncertainty it is causing is doing a lot of harm. Early on, the conservative editorial board of The Wall Street Journal called it “the dumbest trade war in history,” and most economic experts say it has been the worst policy decision ever. Trump himself mused recently that we could be in for a recession. I don’t recall anyone saying they voted to Make America Have A Great Depression Again.
Touting IIJA Investments in Memphis International Airport
On Tuesday, as the Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I touted major improvements made at Memphis International Airport (MEM) because of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the 2024 FAA Reauthorization Act and its $4 billion annual investment for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) at a hearing on airport infrastructure and safety. MEM improvements aren’t just a face-lift but represent a next-generation-level overhaul reflecting Memphis’ role as a logistics leader and gateway to the world. See my release on the hearing here (link is external) .
Introducing the Fair Debt Collection Improvement Act
Also Tuesday, I reintroduced the Fair Debt Collection Improvement Act that would bar debt collectors from bringing legal actions involving a consumer’s debt for which the statute of limitations has expired. See details in my release here (link is external) .
Congratulating Our Congressional App Challenge Winners
On Wednesday, I went to the Capitol Visitor Center to meet and congratulate 14-year-old Kennedy Jefferson and 11-year-old Cathryn Jeff, this year’s 9 th Congressional District winners of the Congressional App Challenge. Their application intends to provide help for struggling students and get them on a path out of generational poverty and on a road to success. Kennedy is homeschooled, and Cathryn goes to the Math, Science, and Technology Magnet School in Marion, Arkansas. I am impressed by Kennedy and Cathryn’s coding skills and social awareness.
Calling Attention to Real ID May 7 Deadline
Anyone planning to fly after May 7 must have a Real ID card or a valid passport. The regular Tennessee driver’s license will not permit passengers onto domestic flights. Please be prepared with the required forms of identification before heading to your Department of Motor Vehicles, which is permitting walk-ins. See FAQs about Real ID requirements here (link is external) .
Announcing $2.6 Million Grant to the Memphis Health Center
This week, I announced that Memphis Health Center Inc. will receive a grant of $2,685,248 to provide mental health and substance abuse services to patients through May 31, 2026 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. See my release here (link is external) .
Applauding $897,000 NIH Grant to St. Jude
On Wednesday, I announced that St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital will receive a grant of $897,250 to study “dynamic RNA-protein assemblies and neurological disease” from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. See details here (link is external) .
Inviting Participation in Congressional Art Competition
Again this year, I am soliciting artwork from 9 th Congressional District high school students for the Congressional Art Competition. It’s an opportunity to recognize and encourage artistic talent across the country. The winner from TN-9 will have his or her work hung in the U.S. Capitol for a year. The deadline to submit artwork is Tuesday, April 22, at noon. See rules and details here (link is external) . If you have further questions, contact my District office at (901) 544-4131.
The Friday Flashback
With baseball starting up, I felt it would be good to flash back to my baseball hero as a child, the great Minnie Minoso. We met at an exhibition game in Russwood Park in 1955 when he -- through a white player because of segregation -- gave me a baseball and befriended me. That initial meeting and the fact that he felt he could not give a five-year-old child on crutches because of polio, the ball directly and had to hand it to a white player made a profound impact on me. We were friends for the rest of his life. This photo was taken at AutoZone Park at the 2007 Civil Rights Game where Minnie was my special guest. Minnie is now in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. Thank you, Minnie, for so many kindnesses and for giving me so many thrills as I watched the box scores of every one of your games from the day I met you until you were out of the majors. Geoff Calkins wrote about Minnie and me in a nice column (link is external) in 2021.
A Bill Day Cartoon -- "Trump's Tariffs"
Weekly Health Tip
Our country’s maternal mortality rate today is worse than it was 25 years ago, especially for Black women. Black women die in childbirth at two to three times the rate of white women. Yet, 80 percent of maternal deaths in the United States are preventable. I am a cosponsor of a resolution identifying the period from today, April 11, until April 17, as Black Maternal Health Week, helping to call attention to the problem and find solutions like my NEWBORN Act (link is external) that I reintroduced last month. For more information about preventing maternal mortality, visit https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/index.html.
Quotes of the Week
“Anyone sounding the all-clear on tariffs, or Trump economic policy in general, should be kept away from sharp objects and banned from operating heavy machinery…Trump’s post-pause tariff regime remains the biggest trade shock in U.S., and I think world history.”  – Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman in a Substack post titled “Trump Is Stupid, Erratic and Weak.” “This is the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen an administration impose on a well-functioning economy.” – Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on CNN.
As always, I remain. Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen Member of Congress

At a Highways and Transit Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday (link is external) , I noted that Project 2025 proposed ending federal support for public transit, which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on it. Trump-Musk are already implementing a variety of Project 2025 proposals, from cuts to the Social Security workforce so it won’t work for beneficiaries, to setting the groundwork for cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, to the elimination of expertise at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) so weather forecasting can be privatized and at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while exempting polluters from the Clean Air Act. They are stripping the Department of Education to the bone and furloughing thousands from other departments and agencies Congress created that they claim are bloated, inefficient, or unneeded. No one voted for this destruction of a working federal government, but many will suffer the consequences unless the public expresses its discontent so that we can swiftly reverse it. See my speech during a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on immigration in which I said Congress has surrendered its Constitutional prerogatives to Trump here (link is external) . Voting Against a Drastic Republican Budget Plan On Wednesday night, I participated in the House floor debate on the Republican-sponsored budget resolution that proposes huge reductions in spending, likely on social safety net programs. I called it what it is — a tax cut giveaway for billionaires, paid for by hardworking Americans.  When Republicans couldn’t pass the measure Wednesday night, they tried again Thursday morning and, unfortunately, it passed 216 to 214. See my release and my floor speech here (link is external) . Introducing the HAPPY BIRTHDAY Budget Act On Wednesday, I introduced the Halting All Parades for Presidents’ Yearly Birthdays; It Risks Taxpayer Harm, Damages, And Your (HAPPY BIRTHDAY) Budget Act. The measure, drafted after press accounts of White House plans to hold a parade from the Pentagon to the White House on Donald Trump’s 79 th birthday on June 14, would prohibit enacting such a plan and any future presidential birthday parades going forward. The measure notes that a proposed $92 million parade planned during the first Trump administration was abandoned and encourages Trump to consider alternatives to fighter jet flyovers for his birthday, including birthday cake, a round of golf or a bingo night. See my release on the measure here (link is external) . Watching Trump Disrupt Markets with Erratic Tariff Announcements and Reversals Trillions of dollars were needlessly erased from 401(K) retirement accounts and savings plans by this irresponsibly erratic President’s threats to impose huge tariffs on our trading partners and then reversing course on most of them on Wednesday for 90 days. This is no way to run economic or trade policy, and the uncertainty it is causing is doing a lot of harm. Early on, the conservative editorial board of The Wall Street Journal called it “the dumbest trade war in history,” and most economic experts say it has been the worst policy decision ever. Trump himself mused recently that we could be in for a recession. I don’t recall anyone saying they voted to Make America Have A Great Depression Again. Touting IIJA Investments in Memphis International Airport On Tuesday, as the Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I touted major improvements made at Memphis International Airport (MEM) because of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the 2024 FAA Reauthorization Act and its $4 billion annual investment for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) at a hearing on airport infrastructure and safety. MEM improvements aren’t just a face-lift but represent a next-generation-level overhaul reflecting Memphis’ role as a logistics leader and gateway to the world.

Congratulating Our Congressional App Challenge Winners On Wednesday, I went to the Capitol Visitor Center to meet and congratulate 14-year-old Kennedy Jefferson and 11-year-old Cathryn Jeff, this year’s 9 th Congressional District winners of the Congressional App Challenge. Their application intends to provide help for struggling students and get them on a path out of generational poverty and on a road to success. Kennedy is homeschooled, and Cathryn goes to the Math, Science, and Technology Magnet School in Marion, Arkansas. I am impressed by Kennedy and Cathryn’s coding skills and social awareness.

The Friday Flashback With baseball starting up, I felt it would be good to flash back to my baseball hero as a child, the great Minnie Minoso. We met at an exhibition game in Russwood Park in 1955 when he -- through a white player because of segregation -- gave me a baseball and befriended me. That initial meeting and the fact that he felt he could not give a five-year-old child on crutches because of polio, the ball directly and had to hand it to a white player made a profound impact on me. We were friends for the rest of his life. This photo was taken at AutoZone Park at the 2007 Civil Rights Game where Minnie was my special guest. Minnie is now in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. Thank you, Minnie, for so many kindnesses and for giving me so many thrills as I watched the box scores of every one of your games from the day I met you until you were out of the majors.

Dear Friend,
This week, I returned to Washington and called attention to the many provisions of the Project 2025 GOP blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term that are being implemented in the chaotic frenzy of his first two months in office. I also spoke from the House floor and then voted against a disastrous Republican budget resolution, introduced a bill to prohibit Trump – or any future president – from holding a military parade for his birthday, watched Trump whipsaw the financial markets with his erratic tariff announcements, touted the major improvements made at the Memphis International Airport by federal infrastructure investments, introduced a bill to help protect debtors from unscrupulous collectors, visited with and congratulated our Congressional App Challenge winners, reminded constituents who want to fly after May 7 to get a Real ID, announced significant federal grants to Memphis Health Center and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, invited talented high school artists to participate in the Congressional Art Competition, and offered a baseball-themed Friday Flashback, a Bill Day cartoon, and a health tip.
