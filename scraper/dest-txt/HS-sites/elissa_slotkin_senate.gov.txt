WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced bipartisan legislation to increase criminal penalties for individuals who commit, or attempt to commit, violent crimes in the United States on behalf of foreign adversaries. The DETERRENCE Act would both hold offenders accountable and deter criminals, including criminal organizations, from taking money from foreign adversaries in exchange for committing crimes on American soil.
“If you commit crimes in America on behalf of foreign adversaries, you must face serious consequences,” said Senator Slotkin. “The bipartisan Deterrence Act helps strengthen penalties for these crimes and sends a clear message about how seriously we take our national security and how we will hold accountable those who commit crimes against our nation.”
“Foreign adversaries are working with gangs and criminals in the United States to try to kill people on our soil, which is a national security risk,” said Senator Hassan . “This bipartisan legislation will crack down on criminals who commit violence on behalf of a foreign government. I urge my colleagues in Congress to quickly take up and pass this legislation and send a clear message to our foreign adversaries that they will face particularly serious consequences if they expand their criminal activity to American soil.”
“We cannot allow foreign adversaries, like Iran, to fund crimes against Americans on our own soil,” said Senator Ernst. “Criminals are on notice, anyone helping to carry out Tehran’s malign ‘death to America’ mission will face severe consequences. The DETERRENCE Act is another peace through strength action that will make bad actors think twice before targeting our citizens.”
Under the DETERRENCE Act , which unanimously passed the U.S. Senate last year, criminals working for foreign adversaries can be sentenced to longer prison sentences. The bill specifically increases criminal penalties for the following federal crimes when the crimes are committed under U.S. jurisdiction on behalf of foreign governments:
This legislation follows reports that foreign adversaries are increasingly turning to criminals in America to commit violent crimes against their critics, including those who reside in the United States. Just recently, two Eastern European organized crime leaders were convicted of murder-for-hire targeting a U.S. based journalist on behalf of the Iranian government. Additionally, the Department of Justice has detailed how Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) allegedly tasked an Iranian asset with creating a plan to assassinate President Trump. ###

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) joined her Democratic colleagues in sending an open letter to the American public warning that Congressional Republicans are trying to take food away from hungry families to give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.
“Congress should not give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans by taking away food assistance from millions of Americans,” wrote the Senators.
“SNAP supports 42 million Americans, including nearly 8 million seniors, 16 million children, 4 million people with disabilities, and 1.2 million veterans, in putting food on their tables each month. Cuts of this magnitude—or anything close to it—would be devastating to American families in every state.”
The full text of the letter is below and can be found here .
An open letter to the public:
The Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are planning to give another round of tax handouts to the ultra-wealthy and corporations paid for by gutting the food assistance that helps American families pay for groceries at a time when they are struggling to afford food, health care, housing, and other household basic needs. If enacted, cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will have severe consequences for millions of veterans, seniors, children, and hard-working farmers.
We write to make our position on this legislation perfectly clear: Congress should not give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans by taking away food assistance from millions of Americans.
Earlier this year, both the House and the Senate passed budget bills that pave the way for deep cuts to SNAP. The House budget bill would require at least $230 billion in cuts. The Senate bill sets a floor of $1 billion in cuts with nothing to prevent it from going as high as the House bill. This would be a more than 20 percent cut to a program that helps millions of struggling families afford groceries.
SNAP supports 42 million Americans, including nearly 8 million seniors, 16 million children, 4 million people with disabilities, and 1.2 million veterans, in putting food on their tables each month. Cuts of this magnitude—or anything close to it—would be devastating to American families in every state. SNAP benefits currently average only $6.20 per person per day. At a time when people across the country are struggling with the high cost of groceries, a cut of this magnitude could result in an immediate increase in food costs, dropping the annual, per person SNAP benefit by over $500 per year per person.
Congressional Republicans might claim that their plan is to merely require states to pay for a portion of food benefits for the first time. In truth, such an unprecedented cost shift could force states to cut benefits, severely restrict program eligibility, or both. If combined with a similar Medicaid cost shift, these unfunded mandates could decimate state budgets and cut healthcare and food assistance for millions of Americans.
Taking away SNAP would also hurt the farmers who grow our food, the manufacturers that package it, truckers who distribute it, and small businesses in our communities that sell it. Each SNAP dollar stimulates the economy: every $1.00 in food assistance provided by the program in a weak economy generates an additional $1.50 in economic activity.3 Because adequate nutrition is so important for children’s health and development, the long-term return on investment is even greater: every $1.00 invested in SNAP for children returns $62 in value.4 In 2020 alone, SNAP supported 200,000 grocery industry jobs and created nearly 45,000 new jobs in supporting industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and municipal services.
Republicans are writing the most consequential tax and budget legislation in decades entirely behind closed doors. That’s because Trump and Congressional Republicans must hide the ugly truth—their legislation feeds corporate and wealthy individuals’ greed by taking food assistance away for tens of millions of Americans. You, your family, and your neighbors deserve far better.
Democrats are fighting to protect American’s ability to feed their families from Republican cuts.
Join us and keep up the fight.

Slotkin, Colleagues Warn About Raising Food Costs to Give Tax Breaks to Billionaires
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) today introduced her first bill in the U.S. Senate. Slotkin introduced the Connected Vehicle National Security Review Act, a bill to formally establish a national security review process for connected vehicles and connected vehicle components manufactured by companies from China or other countries of concern. The legislation would allow the Department of Commerce to limit or ban the introduction of these vehicles or components from U.S. markets if they pose a threat to national security.
Statement from Slotkin:
“I will lay down on the border to keep Chinese vehicles from entering the U.S. market. This is my first bill I’m introducing in the Senate, and it’s for a reason.
“Chinese vehicles could collect huge amounts of data on America and Americans, which poses a significant national security threat. Americans’ personal data, our infrastructure, Michigan’s auto industry and auto jobs are all at stake.
“Chinese vehicles, which are dirt cheap thanks to state subsidies, could collect full motion video of sensitive sites, 3-D mapping, and geolocation of individual drivers – all of which could be sent back to Beijing. Despite the polarization in Washington right now, protecting U.S. citizens should be nonpartisan, and I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to pass this legislation into law.”
The way vehicles are now loaded with information gathering technology, like cameras and other sensors, poses a unique threat presented by vehicles and components from China and other nations. Chinese vehicles have a growing market share in Europe and have now set sights on the North American market .
The Connected Vehicle National Security Review Act would establish in law explicit authorities provided to the U.S. Department of Commerce and other federal agencies under Executive Orders from both the Trump (EO 13873) and Biden (EO 14034) administrations. The bill will provide more explicit statutory authority, strengthening protections against national security risks and ensuring more durable protection against Chinese connected vehicles.
Under the legislation, the Department of Commerce would have the authority to review – and potentially block – any sale, importation, or other transaction that:
Earlier this year, the Biden Administration concluded a Department of Commerce-led investigation into the national security risks of connected vehicles from countries of concern, including China. This resulted in a rule banning the import or sale of Chinese or Russian connected vehicles, as well as connected vehicle hardware and software.
The authorities in this bill would go beyond the limits presented by traditional trade-restriction tools, such as tariffs, which may not prevent countries of concern from establishing production in Mexico or other nations for export to the United States. Under the legislation, any connected vehicle or vehicle component built by a company under the ownership, control or jurisdiction of a country of concern is subject to national security review.
Additionally, Slotkin will be introducing a similar bill that applies to the broader Information and Communications Technology and Services (ICTS) supply chain.
