It is my honor to serve the good people of Northwest Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives. Our government is supposed to work for the American people, not foreign nations, lobbyists, or special interests. That’s why I ran for Congress: to hold our government accountable and ensure that every policy coming out of Washington, D.C. is designed to put America First. Unfortunately, the globalist politicians in Washington, D.C. continue to put the American people last by putting their interests and the interests of other countries first. As a successful businesswoman, I know the meaning of a strong work ethic, and that’s why I’m proud to fight and serve every single day as your voice in Congress. If there is ever anything I can do to better serve you, please do not hesitate to reach out.
Keep up with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene
