WASHINGTON, D.C., (Feb. 13th, 2024) – U.S. Congressman Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) introduced the Cartel Marque and Reprisal Reauthorization Act of 2025. Rep. Mark Messmer (R-Ind.) is a co-lead on the bill with Rep. Burchett . The legislation would authorize President Trump to commission privately armed and equipped actors to seize the persons and property of any cartel, cartel member, or cartel-linked organizations.
"They push millions of dollars in fentanyl into our country with no regard for American lives. It's time to get creative about how we face these threats. These cartels present a serious risk to our national security, and this bill would authorize President Trump to commission Americans to help defend our homeland," said Rep. Burchett .
"I agree with President Trump (link is external) that drug cartels (link is external) are foreign terrorist organizations (link is external) and are a serious threat to all Americans," said Rep. Messmer . "The Cartel Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025 (link is external) would add another arrow in our national security (link is external) quiver, guaranteeing that President Trump has all the authority he needs to protect our citizens from criminal and terrorist-linked threats (link is external) ."
Background:
Under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the authority to “declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.” Letters of marque and reprisal permit the President to authorize private citizens to take action against enemies of the United States, allowing individuals or groups to seize property, capture enemies, or disrupt hostile activities on behalf of the government.

"I agree with President Trump (link is external) that drug cartels (link is external) are foreign terrorist organizations (link is external) and are a serious threat to all Americans," said Rep. Messmer . "The Cartel Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025 (link is external) would add another arrow in our national security (link is external) quiver, guaranteeing that President Trump has all the authority he needs to protect our citizens from criminal and terrorist-linked threats (link is external) ."
