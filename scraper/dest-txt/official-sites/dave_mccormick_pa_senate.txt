Congratulations @DrOz on taking on this important role! Looking forward to working with you.
Congratulations to our very own @eliz_gregory for being named Top Operative of the Year! WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU 👏 👏🇺🇸🇺🇸 @TheAAPC
Incredible that one of the greatest speeches delivered by a president in American history was nearly forgotten to the annals of history. President Lincoln’s powerful message still resonates today.
Thank you, AIPAC! I look forward to standing up for the Jewish community and supporting our relationship with Israel in the US Senate 🇺🇸🇮🇱
So awesome. Proud of my friend and fellow combat veteran, @GarrityForPA ! Thank you for your great service to our commonwealth.
The people of Pennsylvania chose @DaveMcCormickPA to represent them, and I was excited to welcome him to the Senate for orientation. Time to hit the ground running and get America back on track!
Congratulations, Senator Thune! Now the real work begins to ensure that the 119th Congress delivers President Trump’s agenda and brings about the dramatic change that Pennsylvanians demand and were promised.
Thank you, Philadelphia Building Trades! Looking forward to working together to create more jobs and opportunity for all Pennsylvanians.
So honored to be here at Senate Orientation. Grateful to the people of Pennsylvania for placing their trust in me. I will fight everyday for every Pennsylvanian.

Meet Dave McCormick
Dave McCormick has a battle plan for America’s renewal — and he’s ready to bring it and his leadership to the United States Senate on behalf of Pennsylvania.
Dave is a 7th generation Pennsylvanian. He’s a West Point graduate, combat veteran and Bronze star recipient. He’s a Pennsylvania job creator and a business leader. He’s a national security expert and a strong and experienced voice for how to overcome the threat from China. And, most important, he is a devoted husband and father of six bright young women for whom he wants to preserve the American dream.
A trusted, thoughtful leader, Dave will fight for all Pennsylvanians.
Dave was born in Washington, Pennsylvania, and raised in Bloomsburg. The son of two lifelong teachers and prominent educators and the oldest of two boys, Dave was raised to understand the value of hard work. Growing up, Dave played football and wrestled, trimmed Christmas trees, delivered newspapers, and bused tables at the Magee Hotel.
Dave was nominated to the United States Military Academy by a Pennsylvania Senator, and became the first kid from Bloomsburg to attend West Point in decades. After graduating, Dave went on to serve in the 82nd Airborne Division as a paratrooper. He was deployed to the Middle East during the First Gulf War and received the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq before retiring as a Captain.
After the Army, Dave earned his Ph.D. in international relations from Princeton University before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. He worked his way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup that employed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania.
In 2005, Dave was called to service again, this time in the highest levels of government, including as Under Secretary of Treasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. For four years, Dave spearheaded the fight to protect American technology from Chinese theft, advised the President on key national security issues, and helped negotiate the global response to the 2008 financial crisis.
Following the administration, Dave joined Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firms in the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers, firefighters and law enforcement. He served as CEO until he resigned to run for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2022.
Dave and Dina are proud to support organizations that work with veterans and their families.
Dave is committed to using his unique leadership experiences over the last four decades to deliver results for the Keystone State. He isn’t afraid to stand up to both parties to do what’s right, and he’ll do whatever it takes to fix our broken economy and restore the American Dream for all Pennsylvanians and future generations.

Casey in 2021: ‘The risk inflation is pretty low’ PHILADELPHIA, PA. — The Dave McCormick for Senate campaign released a new digital ad this week exposing weak Bob Casey’s repeated lies about the risk of inflation in order to justify voting for the Democrat’s radical multi-trillion dollar agenda. Casey infamously said inflation was temporary and the massive […]
U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D) recently aimed his inflation anger at video streaming services, saying major television and movie streamers have been raising prices while paring back their content offerings — something that fits in to Casey’s “greedflation” campaign platform in which he blames corporations rather than government spending for the inflation that has eroded […]
Democratic Sen. Bob Casey (Pa.) held a stake in a Chinese state oil company that the Pennsylvania treasury department blacklisted over its ties to Iran, according to financial disclosures. In 2014, Casey invested as much as $50,000 in Janus Flexible Bond A, a mutual fund that in turn held $10.8 million in the China National Offshore Oil […]
BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has received financial support from a group lobbying to expand a visa program known to benefit Chinese nationals seeking entry into the United States, Federal Election Commission filings show.

PITTSBURGH, PA. — A recent Washington Post report on Erie, Pennsylvania underscored the economic hardship families across the commonwealth are experiencing because of career politicians’ failed economic agenda.  “While Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Bob Casey lie about the success of Bidenomics, real Pennsylvanians are hurting. Families are suffering because thanks to their radical economic policies, inflation skyrocketed, wages […]
PHILADELPHIA, PA. — Bob Casey just can’t seem to tell the truth — and the people of Pennsylvania are catching on.  Take a look at Bob’s bad week: On Monday, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Bob Casey’s ownership in the very same company he hit McCormick’s former company for in an ad. The McCormick campaign released a new ad highlighting Casey’s […]
PENNSYLVANIA, USA — Republican U.S. Senate Nominee Dave McCormick has been going after his opponent in a critical Pennsylvania election.

Roads, bridges, tunnels, and ports that carry people and goods across America. Gas pipelines that power energy independence and shipyards that build American military dominance.

Big infrastructure projects like these create good-paying jobs for workers and keep Pennsylvania and America moving forward, boosting productivity, accelerating […]
Growing up, I hardly ever imagined myself in the military. No one in my immediate family had served. Numerous veterans call Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania — the town in which I grew up — home, but no one from the area had been to a military academy in decades.  With hard work (and a little luck), I […]
One inch. That’s how close America came to losing Donald Trump to an assassin’s bullet Saturday evening—and that inch may be a metaphor for how close we are to an internal breakdown in the greatest country the world has ever known. Read More
Eighty years ago today, on D-Day, the United States and its allies assembled one of the greatest armadas in history to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation. Now, as global tensions rise, America’s naval power is woefully unprepared to confront the threats of our time, most notably a rising, ambitious and aggressive China. The combined navies […]
Founding Father George Mason warned that the power of the United States Senate must be checked and balanced.

Across my career at the intersection of national security and our economy, I have witnessed firsthand several game-changing technological revolutions. From GPS to the internet and from smartphones to artificial intelligence, our nation’s unmatched capacity to innovate has created unprecedented benefits for the economy and security.
Another wave is upon us: Blockchain and crypto offer America the chance to lead another generation of critical innovation, but policymakers must do their part, or this opportunity will slip away. If the Biden White House and Congress don’t provide the support and regulatory certainty this burgeoning industry requires, there is little doubt it will develop and thrive elsewhere.
After Philadelphia native Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in Hershey during an NBA game — a record that still hasn’t been topped — how did he celebrate? By chugging a carton of milk.
It’s an iconic photo and one of many sports moments involving dairy. Wilt, like so many other Pennsylvanians, grew up with a deep appreciation for the health benefits of milk.
Decades later, milk consumption has fallen dramatically. So where did all that enthusiasm for this classic American dairy product go?
Winning my first wrestling match, graduating from West Point, my first day working in the White House: none of these special moments will ever come close to the joy of becoming a father.
Any parent can tell you that it’s a feeling unlike any other.
My wife Dina and I are blessed to share six amazing daughters between us, and watching them grow into remarkable young women is truly an unparalleled joy.

Join a Coalition
Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, everything costs more, and Bob Casey has blindly supported every disastrous Bidenomics policy that has crushed Pennsylvania families and contributed to our debt spiraling out of control. He even voted to raise taxes on hard working Pennsylvanians while voting to give massive tax breaks to millionaires in California and New York. As a former CEO, Dave has experience creating hundreds of Western Pennsylvania jobs and eliminating wasteful spending. He knows what it’s like to be responsible for the bottom line, and in the Senate he’ll work to rein in government spending, oppose tax increases, and exercise fiscal responsibility to lessen the burden on the people of the commonwealth. As a father to six daughters, Dave knows this is essential for creating opportunities for the next generation entering the workforce.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Bob Casey’s failed border policies have created an enormous economic and national security threat for America and Pennsylvania. Casey has regularly voted against tougher border security measures, has supported sanctuary cities and voted to give illegal immigrants taxpayer-funded federal benefits. He even voted against Kate’s law, which set a mandatory imprisonment minimum for deported felons who illegally enter the U.S. Now, Pennsylvanians are paying for healthcare, schooling, housing, food, you name it, for people who don’t pay taxes as dangerous drugs cross our border and women and children become victims to trafficking. As Senator, Dave will fight to secure the border, put an end to drug and human trafficking, and support our border patrol agents with the resources they need to do their jobs.
Under the Biden-Harris administration, our adversaries see a weakening America. We saw it first in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Then through an emboldened Russia waging war on Ukraine. And most recently in Israel, where Hamas launched an assault on the Israeli people with the support of Iran. Bob Casey has consistently been a rubber stamp for weak and harmful foreign policy decisions — including casting the deciding vote to pass the Iran deal, which gave them billions to fund terrorism. As a combat veteran and a former deputy national security adviser, Dave knows we need a robust defense budget focused on equipping us for next generation warfare. As Senator, he’ll work to restore America’s military might, strengthen our defense industrial base, reestablish deterrence of our adversaries, and make sure the world knows we’re not planning to relinquish our superpower status anytime soon. We must show peace through strength.
Every American deserves to feel safe where they live and work, but dangerous rhetoric and lax law enforcement policies have led to an increase in crime. Urban decay and skyrocketing murder rates are making sections of our great cities a terrifying place to raise children. Fentanyl is killing Americans in every community. As a father, Dave knows firsthand the heightened concern parents have for their children’s safety. Defunding the police, which Bob Casey supported, and declining respect for our law enforcement is diminishing the ability to keep communities safe. And Soros-funded prosecutors in cities like Philadelphia are undermining rule of law, allowing violent criminals to return to the streets. Bob Casey, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ approach isn’t working. That’s why 47 sheriffs from across the commonwealth have endorsed Dave. They know they can trust him to advocate for the needs of law enforcement in Washington.
If Pennsylvania were a country, we would have the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world. But under Biden and Harris’ anti-American energy policies rubberstamped by Bob Casey, we haven’t been able to access clean natural gas, including from the Marcellus Shale. Casey supports policies that are costing us jobs and driving up energy prices even more. He championed a radical cap-and-trade policy, which would have cost Pennsylvania tens of billions of dollars and half a million jobs. The commonwealth used to be an energy exporter, and now we’re an importer. Dave is a conservationist who believes we don’t have to choose between clean energy and economic development – that’s a false tradeoff. Our leaders must mitigate the risk of climate change through adaptation and energy policies that do not impose significant damage on our society, our economy, and our security, and policymakers must reckon with the reality that China and India combined are responsible for a third of global emissions and growing rapidly. America must be energy independent — it’s good for our economy and our national security — and we can do that while simultaneously supporting Pennsylvania’s position as a leader in reducing emissions. We need market-driven solutions and an “all of the above” energy agenda, not government spending that drives inflation.
Dave is the proud son of two Pennsylvania teachers, so he’s spent much of his life hearing about how we as a country can deliver the best possible education for America’s children. Jim and Maryan McCormick saw the education and development of the next generation as the most important thing we must do as a country. Unfortunately, our education system is currently failing America’s children, and the numbers are staggering. Only 25 percent of graduating seniors could keep up with a college‐level math class, and 37 percent were ready for college‐level reading. The average high school graduate today is no better educated than she would have been twenty‐five years ago, and neither poor nor rich students are doing better. As a result, American students are falling behind the rest of the world.
Dave has a plan to revamp our education system with a talent strategy that revives and unlocks the courageous, entrepreneurial American spirit. This starts by improving the quality of our schools by expanding school choice, committing to free expression, and valuing civics and the formation of good citizens. We must also create new workforce training programs and accord job training and community colleges the same respect—and financial support—our country directs toward a four‐year college education. Equipping America’s next generation with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce is essential to the prosperity of our country and our people.
Fentanyl is pouring across our southern border and ravaging communities, killing over 4,000 Pennsylvanians a year — and Bob Casey has been a rubber stamp for the horrendous border policies that enabled this crisis. As a father, Dave is extremely concerned about fentanyl falling into the hands of our children, and at the end of the day, he knows this crisis will not get better until we have operational control of the southern border and stop the unabated flow of Chinese fentanyl ingredients and drug money into the Western Hemisphere. He believes the federal government needs to go after the suppliers and traffickers that produce and bring fentanyl into the United States and sanction the financial flows that facilitate it. We must use sanctions, intelligence resources, military interdictions at sea, and all other tools at our disposal to make it as difficult as possible for drug cartels to produce fentanyl with ingredients originating in China.
From its beginning, America has been a cauldron of invention and innovation. The steel Pennsylvanians produced built cities and the coal and oil they extracted powered cars, factories, and people’s homes. Innovation likewise turned America into a military juggernaut and eventually a superpower after World War II. While CEO of FreeMarkets, a technology software company in Pittsburgh, Dave had a front row seat to the information revolution and saw how the flurry of technological adoption overhauled entire industries. It had a tremendously positive effect on American businesses and, more importantly, American workers. Today, we need to re-energize innovation, including through improving education in math, science, and engineering as well as technical skills training, and driving technological and data leadership which would in turn boost productivity and economic dynamism. Together, they would reverse the cycle of stagnation that holds our country back and form the foundation of the great American renewal.
China poses the gravest threat to our security and well-being since the end of World War II, and career politicians like Bob Casey have gotten China wrong for more than two decades. Dave believes our prosperity, our security, and our values are at risk. Senator Casey has been in Washington since 2007 and has failed to exercise leadership on behalf of Pennsylvanians to address this significant and growing threat. Instead, he has been a rubber stamp for policies that have weakened America and made us more dependent on China, including growing reliance on lithium batteries and solar panels. That’s why Dave introduced a plan to fortify American military and economic strength, thwart China’s aggressive ambitions and protect the homeland through six bans to end China’s free ride. You can read his plan here .
As a combat veteran, Dave knows that serving your country involves personal sacrifice. Too many of our nation’s veterans don’t get the care they deserve after coming home, and as a result, many struggle with their mental health, with a devastating twenty-two veterans a day taking their own lives. Dave knows that we need to equip our veterans with not just quality health care, but mental health care. That’s why he’s met with both veterans and officials to discuss ways to help those who are struggling after their service. We have an obligation to protect those who protected us. Dave also believes that most veterans excel in civilian society, which is why he always made a point to hire them while leading teams at both FreeMarkets and Bridgewater. Veterans are well‐trained young men and women with unlimited potential, and they often have incredible leadership experience and technical skills from their service. As Pennsylvania’s Senator, Dave will work to connect veterans with job opportunities in the private and public sector to help them succeed following their service to our country.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Bob Casey’s failed agenda is wreaking havoc on our country, both at home and abroad. Democrats are trying to enact a sweeping, federal takeover of elections that erases common sense requirements like presenting a photo ID to vote, requiring that ballots be in by Election Day, and ensuring adequate observers and oversight before and during the election. We need to beat our Democratic opponents in November by mobilizing every Pennsylvanian who wants better leadership in Washington and ensuring they vote, whether that be by mail or on Election Day. Every Pennsylvanian needs to be able to have faith and confidence in our elections.
Dave recognizes that this is an incredibly polarizing issue and we need to seek policies that unify the country. Dave is pro-life, is opposed to a national abortion ban, and supports exceptions in the cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. In Pennsylvania, the current law, supported by both Republicans and Democrats, means abortion is legal through 24 weeks. Meanwhile, Bob Casey Jr. has the extreme position of supporting abortion up until the moment of birth. Bob Casey’s position is out of step with Pennsylvania, with America, and with his own late father.
Dave is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and believes law-abiding citizens have an individual right to own firearms for self-defense, hunting, collecting, and sport-shooting, for any lawful reason, and neither Congress nor the states can take that away. As a responsible gun owner and a concerned father, Dave believes that we must increase school security across the board, and provide the money to do so, with school security officers. Second, we need to expand our mental health programs and reduce the stigma associated with seeking treatment. Third, prosecutors like Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner have to enforce the laws we have on the books. It’s unacceptable that some of the cities with the most stringent gun laws have the highest violent crime rates because of a lack of enforcement by liberal prosecutors. Finally, we need to make sure our law enforcement have the resources they need to protect our communities, and that we have rigorous background check systems, as we have in Pennsylvania. We need to preserve our rights while keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.
American leadership on blockchain and crypto is critical to our economic and national security. They offer America the chance to lead another generation of innovation, but policymakers must do their part, or this opportunity will slip away. Across my career at the intersection of national security and our economy, I have witnessed first hand several game-changing technological revolutions — and this one is key. Allentown and Philadelphia are already home to growing blockchain and crypto ecosystems, and by 2030, the industry is expected to support as many as 4 million jobs. Pennsylvania could reap the benefits of this boom, but only with leaders who recognize that blockchain and crypto are an economic engine. Read my op-ed on my approach to crypto policy here .
As a combat veteran and former government official who has lived the American Dream, Dave is a fierce defender of our values, and believes the progressive left is embracing an ideology that is undermining the basic tenets of our democracy. We need new leaders to cultivate the American spirit and restore institutional integrity: in the Pentagon, to put war fighting and deterrence first; in schools, to teach civics and America’s exceptional story; in business, to reaffirm the principles of merit and capitalism; and across society, to create a new national commitment to citizenship. Dave will always stand up for the truth with moral clarity.
Dave wants to go to Washington to deliver results for Pennsylvanians — not to become a career politician like Bob Casey. Dave supports term limits and will not serve more than two terms in the Senate if elected.
Dave also believes in protecting the integrity of the Senate through preserving the filibuster, which is one of the last stopgaps against political extremism in the country. There needs to be a check on simple majority rule, which is what our founders intended when they created the Senate.

ENDING CHINA’S FREE REIN

STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES
THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON
Ideas and leadership matters—and in this crucial moment, Washington is short on both.
Over the course of this campaign, Dave is laying out his Keystone Agenda to Reclaim America, outlining the most important challenges facing Pennsylvania and the nation and what we can do about them.
China poses the gravest threat to our security and well-being since the end of World War II, and our nation’s leaders — including career politicians like Senator Bob Casey — have gotten China wrong for more than two decades.
We are in a contest for our prosperity, our security, our values — our very way of life. If we lose, we sacrifice the future long-promised to my daughters and their children.
Casey has been in Washington since 2007 and has had every opportunity to exercise leadership on behalf of Pennsylvanians to address this significant and growing threat. Instead, he has been a rubber stamp for policies that have weakened America and made us more dependent on China.
Dave has a plan to fortify American military and economic strength, thwart China’s aggressive ambitions and protect the homeland through six bans to end China’s free ride.
Four thousand deadly overdoses in Pennsylvania each year is a tragedy and an outrage. We must not tolerate the flow of billions of dollars of fentanyl ingredients and laundered money from China. It’s time to use sanctions, intelligence resources, military interdictions at sea, and all other tools at our disposal to make it as difficult as possible for drug cartels to produce fentanyl with ingredients originating in China.
Inviting China into the World Trade Organization gave China preferential access to the U.S. market, and instead of following the rules and meeting its free trade obligations, what did China do? They cheated, stole, and took advantage of weak American leaders. It’s time to get tough. Congress must revoke China’s permanent normal trade relations status, and the United States must advocate for China’s removal from the WTO.
The Biden-Harris Administration’s green climate crusade is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into things like electric vehicles and solar panels that make the U.S. even more dependent on China. It might as well be a direct transfer from Pennsylvanians’ bank accounts to the CCP. Being dependent on China for advanced energy technologies like lithium batteries and solar panels repeats the same mistake we made with semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
American innovation, money, and hard work must no longer underwrite the CCP’s efforts to become the world’s leading superpower. It’s unconscionable to consider the possibility that U.S. dollars would fund a military buildup that could one day be deployed against Pennsylvania’s sons and daughters. We must now presume that Chinese companies seeking U.S. financing or technology will become partners to China’s military and security services—whether willingly or not. That’s why Congress must establish a clear outbound investment regime that cuts off U.S. investment in all technologies in China critical to national security and in those companies that work with the People’s Liberation Army. All publicly traded companies and investment funds should also disclose their investments and exposure in China in public filings.
The recklessness of the Chinese Communist Party and its Wuhan Institute of Virology unleashed COVID-19 on the world. They then deprived the United States and our public health institutions of crucial warning to prepare for the pandemic, refused to provide transparency on its potential origin, and co-opted international organizations like the WHO to spread their COVID propaganda.
The pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine have made clear the importance of food security to our economy. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers give us the ability to feed ourselves and many countries around the world. That is a strategic asset and source of independence. We cannot ever allow that to change. All significant purchases of American land by Chinese nationals or companies, as well as purchases near military bases, and critical infrastructure should undergo a national security review. Dave will defend our agriculture industry and our homeland from the CCP.
Dave’s Keystone Agenda builds off his battle plan for renewal outlined in his book Superpower in Peril, which gives us a path to victory in three vital contests of our time: the races for talent, technology, and data supremacy.
If there was one thing we could do to unlock a bright economic future for Pennsylvania, unleashing the commonwealth’s natural resources would be it.
The only thing stopping Pennsylvania from becoming an energy superpower is red tape, backward thinking, and Washington bureaucrats like Senator Bob Casey and President Joe Biden. They are pursuing an anti-fossil fuel agenda that constrains energy production and infrastructure, raises costs, makes us more dependent on the Chinese Communist Party, and kills manufacturing jobs.
Dave believes we need leaders who will reject this agenda and the radical environmental groups behind it and instead prioritize America’s energy future.
Based on his experience as a job creator and a government official who advanced America’s energy security, Dave has a three-step plan to achieve American energy dominance by tapping into Pennsylvania’s abundant natural resources. We can do this while still protecting the environment and making the country the leader in clean energy technology.
We should remove Biden and Harris’ constraints on new oil and gas projects on federal lands, reverse the liquified natural gas export pause, and enact permitting reform. Prioritizing the construction of new energy infrastructure — particularly for projects that will help get natural gas from Pennsylvania to the world — is good for our commonwealth’s economy, consumers, and the environment.
If Pennsylvania cannot provide affordable and reliable energy, key industries like manufacturing and the jobs they support will go elsewhere or overseas to places like China. From natural gas to clean energy solutions like nuclear and emerging technologies like carbon capture and storage, we should be utilizing all forms of energy to help lower prices and drive innovation.
We must end our reliance on China for energy products like solar panels and electric vehicle components. The supply chains for these technologies should be based right here in America whenever possible or, if not, in countries that are reliable trade partners. Leveraging our resources at home will boost our energy independence and national security.
Washington D.C. today is broken. Millions of families across our Commonwealth know it, and so does Dave.. Senator Bob Casey is a career politician who has been in Washington for 18 years. He has had his chance to confront these problems. He hasn’t, and just look at the results. He must be replaced in November.
Dave learned over more than 20 years in the private sector as a business leader that driving fundamental change requires taking on root causes, in this case three sources of the current stagnation in Washington: changing the culture in the capital, taking on an entrenched bureaucracy that resists change, and fixing misguided incentives.
This is Dave’s three-part plan to take on the culture of Washington, rein in federal overreach, and improve Congress to make our government work for you, the American people.
You can read the white pager on Dave’s plan to Shake Up Washington here.
At their best, families are the core of our lives — and the core of our nation. They are what a great writer called the “little platoons” that shape who we are and give us a sense of meaning. They are our home and the foundation of our communities. They prepare each generation of Americans for their futures.
For far too long, career politicians in Washington have made life harder, not easier, for working families in Pennsylvania and across the country. Under the watch of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Pennsylvania’s liberal Senator, Bob Casey, these problems are getting worse, not better.
Dave’s pro-family agenda highlights problems facing American families at every stage of life, from pregnancy to childhood, adulthood, and retirement, and lays out four priorities for families that he will prioritize as Pennsylvania’s next Senator.
As PA’s senator, Dave will oppose any effort to restrict IVF. Period. But he’ll go even further. Every family should get a $15,000 tax credit for fertility expenses like IVF. This credit would put up to $15,000 in the pocket of families using IVF to have children, be fully refundable, and available in up to two tax years per family.
When Dave was a CEO, he strongly encouraged everyone on the team to take paid leave—regardless of whether they were the mom or the dad. He believes Congress should incentivize more employers to provide paid parental leave by making the Paid Family and Medical Leave Employer Tax Credit that was passed during the Trump Administration permanent and expanding it to cover more forms of paid leave, such as insurance, to give small businesses more flexibility.
And for new and newly-adoptive parents who do not have access to paid leave or do not receive 100% percent of their wages during leave, we should allow them to pull forward up to three months of their Social Security benefits to finance it. While three months is a relatively small amount of time in retirement, for new parents this could provide a lifeline at a crucial time for their new family.
Low- and middle-income families are eager to utilize childcare offered by faith-based and community organizations. But the childcare plan that Biden, Harris, and Casey support would have also forced many faith-based organizations to choose between their religious mission and providing childcare services eligible for federal assistance while raising the average cost of childcare by $13,000 per year. Federal assistance programs should incentivize states to make it easier for faith-based and community organizations to open a childcare facility by streamlining licensing, relaxing worker education requirements, or reforming zoning.
Dave also believes we should expand eligibility for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to 1.5 times the state median income for the equivalent size family and increase funding for the block grant. This would make a Pennsylvania family of four making $150,000 eligible for a voucher to use at the eligible child care provider of their choice. This ensures that parents, not bureaucrats in Washington, can decide where they use this assistance for childcare.
Empower parents and expand school choice through a federal tax credit for contributions to scholarship funds.
As the son of two Pennsylvania public school teachers, Dave believes parents should have the right to choose the school that is best for their child, rather than being forced to attend failing schools based solely on where they live. We should be funding student success, not systems that fail to deliver results.
Dave also supports the Educational Choice for Children Act, which would create a federal tax credit that allows individuals and businesses to make tax-deductible contributions to organizations that provide scholarships to low- and middle-income families. This could provide tens of thousands of Pennsylvania students with scholarships to attend the school of their choice, all funded by private donations.
Social media is addictive and anxiety-inducing, and it’s a major driver of the mental health crisis among American teenagers. We need to come together in a bipartisan way to address this crisis and protect children by properly treating kids under 16 as minors needing protection from the harmful effects of social media.
Dave would give every working family access to a tax-free savings account to pay for up to $10,000 per year in childcare costs. Eligibility for the FSA would begin in the middle of pregnancy and be available to any family with earnings to fund it and not be tied to a particular employer.
One of the most important federal policies that supports families is the Child Tax Credit. The 2017 Trump tax cuts doubled the credit, allowing low- and middle-income families to receive up to $2,000 per child each year, of which up to $1,600 is fully refundable. President Trump and Republicans let parents keep more money—Bob Casey and Democrats voted against it.
Dave believes we should do even more: he supports increasing the child tax credit to $4,200 per child under the age of 5 and $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and giving families the option to receive the credit in monthly installments, from mid-pregnancy to a child’s seventeenth birthday.
Mental health is another important priority because far too many Americans with serious mental illness are not able to get the care they need. We can expand access to care for those with serious mental illness by getting rid of Medicaid rules that significantly constrain access to inpatient psychiatric beds, increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for care of the seriously mentally ill, and expanding access to mental health services at the VA.
America is in a generational fight for global primacy. The sad fact is that we’re falling behind, and our adversaries are gaining ground. Under the leadership of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, America is less safe. Their weakness is the reason our national security is under attack around the world.
To restore peace and deter our enemies, America must rebuild its strength. I saw that firsthand as a young lieutenant in the 82nd Airborne Division during Operation Desert Storm. We need leaders who prioritize military power, who don’t make empty threats, and, most of all, who will always fight for America.
Dave spent more than 20 years in the private sector. Right here in Western Pennsylvania, he helped create hundreds of jobs during the Pittsburgh renaissance as CEO of a software company called FreeMarkets. Dave later went on to become CEO of one of the world’s largest investment firms. As a CEO, he learned a few fundamental lessons about our economy.
Unfortunately, weak liberal politicians like Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey and Vice President Kamala Harris have not learned those lessons.
Harris and Casey pushed through more than $5 trillion in new spending that increased prices for hundreds of millions of Americans. And now you’re literally paying the price. Groceries and rent are up 22% and interest rates to buy a new home or car have nearly doubled. And the Harris-Casey war on Pennsylvania energy has disincentivized energy production here at home, sending gas prices up nearly 50%.
Unlike Casey, Dave comes from a world where you’re judged on your performance and held accountable for your decisions. As a business leader, the buck stopped with him. People’s jobs and the returns to our investors depended on the decisions that he made. Unlike Bob Casey, Dave know what it takes to create new jobs, support small businesses, and attract good-paying jobs back to communities in Pennsylvania and across America.
As your next senator, Dave will shake up Washington and tackle the economic problems facing our country. With lower taxes, fewer regulations, a cheap and abundant energy supply, a new generation of talented workers, and free and fair trade, we can forge a new era of American renewal that creates opportunities for every working family in Pennsylvania and across the nation.
Dave will work to lower costs and create greater economic opportunities by:

Dave McCormick’s Day One Promises for Pennsylvania
On the campaign trail, Dave often references a set of policies outlined in his book, Superpower in Peril: A Battle Plan to Renew America. His ideas fit the unique moment in history in which we find ourselves, and give us a path to victory in three vital contests of our time: the races for talent, technology, and data supremacy.
The first part of the agenda is a talent strategy that revives and unlocks the courageous, entrepreneurial American spirit. We must reimagine how we educate people, through school choice; dramatically expand opportunities for workforce development; reform immigration to protect our sovereignty and serve the needs of Americans; and foster a sense of civic duty in each new generation.
Second is a strategy for technological leadership. Washington must take a more active role in promoting American innovation, using government policy to drive private sector capital towards technologies and sectors critical to America’s future. At the same time, Washington must cut the red tape and get out of the way of private citizens and firms trying to innovate.
The third and final piece is a strategy for winning the race for data leadership and getting Big Tech under control. It would protect Americans’ privacy and the public square, and it would put our country in a position to lead in the most dynamic and important industries of the future. We’re in a contest with China for dominance in the digital age, and this strategy lays out a path to victory.
If we began a campaign of national renewal, all citizens would receive a better start in life and a fairer shot at the American dream. We would win the race for technological development, triggering greater innovation and productivity growth and creating more well‐paying jobs. People would have the training and support they needed to flourish in those roles. We would all be freer to live, work, and dream, knowing our privacy was protected in our online world. We would usher in a new era of American leadership, and our nation would be more secure against the predations of the Chinese Communist Party. Our government would finally wake from its doldrums and start meeting the moment. Businesses, schools, and all other institutions would refocus on their core missions. Our nation would break out of the cycle of stagnation that mires us now. America would get moving again.
However, the national renewal agenda will not be possible without leadership to ensure the United States stands up for itself in the world, confronts China, builds new coalitions of willing partners, and reasserts leadership in this new era of geopolitical confrontation. And it will not be possible without leadership across the core institutions of American life to revive the American spirit – the restlessness that comes with liberty and the ambition born of access to the American dream.
These are some of the key ideas and principles Dave will champion in Washington as Pennsylvania’s next Senator. It is now time for us, as a country, to begin the hard work of renewal. It is time to heal the partisan wounds that have for too long divided our country. It is time for leaders to step up and for the men and women charged with the public trust to leave past grievances behind and lead America forward.
Our superpower is in peril, but with a battle plan for renewal, we can come back from the brink.

Program Description: Without limiting the scope of the Program, users that opt into the Program can expect to receive messages concerning alerts, donation requests, updates, and other important information from us. Message and data rates may apply. The Program involves mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent based on your interaction with Us. Message frequency varies. Carriers are not liable for delivered or undelivered messages.
This Mobile Messaging Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy included below are strictly limited to the Program and have no effect on any other terms and conditions and privacy policy(ies) that may govern the relationship between you and Us in other contexts.  Please make sure you review those separate Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies , located on our website, to review and understand those governing terms.
User Opt In: The Program allows users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by users affirmatively opting into the Program, such as through online enrollment forms or by texting a provided keyword to 33055 or any successor short code to opt into the Program.  By opting-in, you hereby recognize and agree you are providing your express consent to receive recurring mobile messages from multiple long codes or any successor short code used by Us at the provided phone number and that you have the authority to opt the provided phone number into our Program.  Messages may be sent by Us directly or by third-parties acting on our behalf.  Regardless of the opt-in method you utilize to join the Program, you agree that these Terms apply to your participation in the Program. The mobile messaging service used by Us to communicate with you requires human intervention for Our mobile messages to be initiated and sent, and thus Our mobile messages are not sent to you by an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Nevertheless, by participating in the Program, YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE TO RECEIVE AUTODIALED MARKETING MOBILE MESSAGES FROM US AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CONSENT IS NOT REQUIRED AS A CONDITION TO PARTICIPATE OR TO MAKE ANY PURCHASE FROM US.
User Opt Out: To opt out (discontinue participation in Program), reply “STOP” to 33055, or to any of Our mobile messages from your mobile device. Sending “STOP” is the easiest and preferred method to opt out of the Program. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt out and you hereby consent to the receipt of such opt out confirmation message.

Our Warranty: We will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any mobile messages connected with this Program. Delivery of mobile messages is subject to effective transmission from your wireless service provider/network operator and is outside of Our control.
Privacy Policy: We respect your right to privacy and you should review our Privacy Policy before opting into our texting Program. We will only use information you provide to transmit your mobile messages and respond to you, if necessary. WE DO NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER FOR PROFIT ANY PHONE NUMBERS OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE PROGRAM TO ANY THIRD PARTY. Nonetheless, We reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect Our rights or property. When you complete forms online or otherwise provide Us information in connection with the Program, you agree to provide accurate, complete, and true information. You agree not to use a false or misleading name or a name that you are not authorized to use.

This Privacy Policy is strictly limited to the Program and has no effect on any other privacy policy(ies) that may govern the relationship between you and Us in other contexts.  Please make sure you review those separate Privacy Policies, located on our website, to understand those governing terms.
Dispute Resolution: In the event that there is a dispute, claim or controversy between you and Us, or between you and any third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to transmit the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, these Terms, Our Privacy Policy, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute, claim or controversy will be determined by arbitration in Washington, D.C. before one arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS. For claims greater than $250,000, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced will apply. For claims less than or equal to $250,000, the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced will apply. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the District of Columbia, exclusive of its conflict or choice of law rules. Nothing in this paragraph will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in this paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms. Either party may commence arbitration by providing to JAMS and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested (“Arbitration Demand”).
To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties agrees that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The appointed arbitrator may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the state law designated above. In making his or her determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision of these Terms. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the “Award”) to each party, who will promptly act in accordance the Award. Any Award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed or enforced in any court having jurisdiction, including any court having jurisdiction over either party or its assets. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and will not be subject to appeal or review. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the court reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with that aspect of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees awards will be offset. The parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by any applicable law. Any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration hereunder will be treated as confidential by the parties, witnesses and arbitrators, and will not be disclosed to any third person (other than witnesses or experts), except as required by any applicable law or except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or is otherwise obtained independently of the arbitration.
