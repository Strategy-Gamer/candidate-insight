Women should once again and permanently have the right to CHOOSE their own reproductive care needs, including care for abortions, miscarriages and any other care that has to do with their reproductive systems, including contraception. When a woman does not have the right to make decisions about her own body, she is not a free citizen.
Woman should have the right to be paid equally for the same job as a man. We have been fighting this one way too long. Child marriage needs to be abolished in all 50 states. 44 states still allow underage children to be married. The large majority are young underage girls, marrying much older adult men. They are usually forced to marry their abusers in most cases, which protects the abusers from prosecution. It is disgusting and reprehensible and must stop!
Victims of sexual abuse including males, should be able to report their abuse and prosecute, without time limits. 34 states still have time limits as to when a child or adult can report their abuse and prosecute their abusers.
12 million girls around the world are victims of child marriage.
Take money out of politics, so the fossil fuel industry cannot bribe politicians while they watch the earth die.
Taxes are unavoidable, how else are things paid for?

VOTING RIGHTS & ELECTION REFORM

LGBTQ+ RIGHTS * The community will have the same rights as the straight community. * Codify the right of gay couples to marry * Protection from discrimination of any kind. * Gay parents will have the same rights to adopt a child and will go through have the same requirements as a straight couple and will not be discriminated against.
PARENTAL RIGHTS * Parents should decide what to do about their own child’s health care needs, including transgender issues. * Parents should decide what their own children should read and study. CHILDREN Children have the right to be able to read and study more, not less. Children have the right to feel safe in school from gun violence. Children have the right not to die by gun fire, which is the number one killer of children in this country!
GUNS * Stop the insanity!! Gun violence is the number one killer of children in this country!!!! * Stricter gun laws and red flag laws. * Guns need to be kept out of the hands of the mentally ill and the addicted. * I stand with the police and veterans who agree that assault weapons of any type, need to be kept off the streets and out of the homes of Americans. These are machines of war, invented for nothing else but killing as many as quickly as possible.
IMMIGRATION * Hate and discrimination must be punished. * More judges and legal help to speed up immigration status. * Cruelty free and human border policies * A final and clear path to citizenship for all immigrants and DACA recipients. * Faster path to work permits. * New and common-sense ideas for the border.

TAXES * Taxes are unavoidable, how else are things paid for? * Protect the IRS so they can go after the super-rich who cheat and use loopholes to not pay any or hardly any taxes. * Get rid of the loopholes and tricks for the rich while filing taxes. * The average American pays more taxes than the super-rich do. Tax the super-rich and the budget would be balanced. * Once again get money out of politics, so the rich corporations and individuals who cheat cannot bribe politicians to vote against them paying their fair share.
VOTING RIGHTS AND ELECTION REFORM * A non-partisan federal computer design for calculating district and county boundaries to stop gerrymandering, should be adopted. * Federal law that says all legal citizens who are accused of a felony and have finished their punishment, should be able to vote. * Corporate money and dark money need to be illegal in campaigns. * Lying about an election’s integrity without real proof should be punishable by law. * ALL intimidation of any kind towards any individual or specific group of voters should be punishable by law.
SOCIAL SECURITY, HUD AND SNAP * All mistakes that Social Security, SNAP and HUD make are their responsibility NOT the recipients. * All programs should have a non-partisan judge to go before for appeals, not an employee or legal team from that organization. * New calculation formulas need to be invented for terminating payments. * When Social Security gives a raise, it should be an amount and not a percentage. The poorest should get the most and the richest the least especially when the poorest live below the poverty line. * More protection for the renters of HUD properties, instead of the owners. * More accountability for the owners of HUD Properties when receiving payments to repair items. Was the money used appropriately? * Owners of HUD properties are NOT allowed to be on the state HUD boards. * All books kept by HUD owners must be reviewed by independent accountants assigned by HUD NOT the owners. * When these programs tell us what our rights are, they need to provide lawyers to help us get those rights, NOT lawyers from legal aid. Especially when owners mistreat residents. * Social Security disability must make it easier for the disabled to run for political office.

SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN
We rely on our supporters to help us make a difference
Hi, I’m Lore Bergman, and I am running for U.S. House of Representatives, for the Congressional 6th District, against the Republican incumbent John Rose. I am running for many reasons, because there are so many issues to fight for right now. The world is on fire due to the climate crisis and wars, and we must end terrorism, help our allies, BUT always protect the innocent people caught in the crossfire. Hate, bigotry and racism are growing at alarming rates, and democracies and voting rights, are being attacked all over the world. The US House of Representatives is a mess, embarrassing our country, putting our own national security in danger and weakening our image in the eyes of the world. And the present representative of district 6, John Rose, is contributing to the chaos with his extreme MAGA views and votes.
As the only woman in this race, I will fight for all woman’s rights and the right to have control over our own bodies. I will fight to end the insanity of gun violence and will always advocate for stricter and common-sense gun laws, and for the banning of assault weapons and automatic type weapons permanenetly, and not books or black history. And I stand with all veterans and police officers, who agree that there is no need for weapons of war in our homes or on our streets. Presently guns seem to have more rights, than children or us women do. Right? I will fight that all Social Security programs, HUD and affordable housing, SNAP, Medicare, Medicaid, drug prices, eyeglasses, hearing aids and all the other programs that help the most vulnerable will be improved and expanded, not gutted, and that all Americans will finally get health care and have a hospital close by. And by the way, the reason all our rural hospitals are closing, is because the Republicans refuse to expand Medicaid. I will also fight for immigrants, so that they can have a speedier path toward work visas and citizenship, and that they will be treated with empathy and cruelty free policies and border reforms. And that all parents and the gay community can decide how they and their children will live.
Trying to run for office has been a huge endeavor, and I have been told if you aren’t rich or have rich friends, you don’t have a chance. Well, I have something else. I have many personal experiences, including political organizing, activism and being an advocate for the elderly and disabled, including veterans. And I am proud to say that just recently, I have received the Gun Sense Distinction from Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. The results of gun violence are now considered America’s worst health crisis and I will do everything in my power to change that.
All my life experiences have convinced me to run. They have given me great empathy and understanding, which will serve me well when I am representing the 6th District. I needed women’s reproductive health care when I had a miscarriage years ago and I shudder to think what I would have to go through today, to get the help I need, now. It’s hard to believe that my grandmother had more rights 2 years ago, than my college age niece has now. I became homeless when I fought a landlord who was harming the disabled and the elderly in my apartment building. He retaliated against me, pushing me out of my apartment and within less than a year I was living in my car, and did so until I could find affordable housing again. My dog and I barely survived. So, believe me when I say, “I will put myself on the line for you”, I will, because I have already done so, and I will do it again, if necessary. I am a first generation American, from a long line of immigrants, from the former Yugoslavia. I know how hard immigrants work and that the majority by far, are good people and deserve to be treated with humanity and respect. I know how hard it is to deal with childhood sexual abuse, because I have had to heal from it, and I stand with all survivors, and their right to prosecute their abusers, without any time limits. I was raised in an extreme religion, and understand how people can be easily sucked into cult like groups, and deceived. And as a disabled American, I understand what it is like to need help from the government and how all the programs work, because I have had to actually use them. All these experiences will guide me as I represent the people of the 6th District.
The disabled are very underrepresented in Washington, and Congress needs our perspective. Living with a disability is something I know all too well, because I was born with some crazy genetics, and I know that the very programs that are made to help, need many changes and improvements and I have many ideas about how that can be done. I am so tired of hearing rich congressmen, like John Rose, speak about programs they know nothing about and never will. They want to gut programs that are needed for the most disadvantaged and poor people in this country and state. I want to literally pull my hair out when I hear them speak about how they plan to balance the federal budget. They cause great anxiety and panic for the most vulnerable in this country that are already barely surviving, when these Republicans threaten their stupid ideas to cut programs like Social Security. It is wrong and it needs to stop! And by the way, the federal budget could be balanced, but the majority in the House refuse to tax the super-rich, because certain Congressmen are the super-rich, and are also receiving “donations” or basically bribes, to vote the way their donors desire. And once again John Rose fits this description, because he is in the top 25 riches members in Congress today and that includes the Senate. Oh, and corporate money, dark money and Citizens United need to be removed from our political system!! As I stated before, I became homeless fighting for the most disadvantaged and I can guarantee, that I will fight for the disabled, elderly, poor and disadvantaged again and I have pages of legislative ideas for that, and I can’t wait to bring it to the floor of Congress.
Tennessee is one of the poorest states in the country and District 6 has much poverty. And all over the country and Tennessee, more children and adults are hungry and homeless than ever before. We need to make sure that all the counties in our state are being represented and treated fairly, not just the few counties we have in our state that are doing well. We need new jobs and affordable housing throughout the whole district, good schools and libraries for all children, and healthcare finally for all Americans. And by the way, I believe healthcare is a human right. And then, let’s not forget our farmers who need to be able to get the help they need also, so we can grow our own products here in America again and that farmers can make a good living doing it. I will make sure that all the people, including the most vulnerable people in District 6 will be heard, and that I represent them well in Washington! I hope you will help me accomplish all these goals. Please join my “Love thy Neighbor” campaign by donating, volunteering and of course voting for me! And remember, if you want something done right, ask a woman! Thank You.
