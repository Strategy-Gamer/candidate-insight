Democrat for Georgia's 14th District
Shawn believes that more important than being on Team Red or Team Blue is being on Team Georgia ‚Äî squarely on the side of hard-working Georgians trying to build a good life. That means listening to our neighbors, standing with our fellow Georgians, tackling the practical problems facing our communities, and making sure we are getting value back from the tax money we send to Washington.

Shawn Harris for Georgia
Shawn grew up in Blakely, Georgia, on his family‚Äôs farm. After high school, Shawn enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, rising to the rank of Sergeant. Later he got his B.A. in Agribusiness at Tuskegee University, where Shawn was a member of Omega Psi Phi, and where he and Karla met and married.
After 9/11, Shawn was deployed as an infantry commander in Afghanistan, where he saw extensive combat. Shawn later served as a senior military advisor in posts around the world. Shawn was awarded several military honors for leadership and valor, and he also earned a degree in Strategic Studies from the Army War College.
Shawn‚Äôs life has now come full circle back to the Georgia countryside. After conversations with neighbors around Rockmart, Shawn has established a campaign to run for Congress as the Democratic Party nominee against Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Shawn Harris for Georgia
I¬†grew up on a Georgia farm, and¬†I¬†enlisted in the Marines to serve my country. My wife Karla and¬†I have been married for 35 years. She became a family doctor while¬†I served, and we raised 5 kids and¬†have¬†4 grandkids. After spending 40 years in the military, including serving as a combat infantry commander in Afghanistan,¬†I¬†retired from the military as an Army General, and Karla and¬†I¬†came right back here to Georgia to live on the farm. We are feeling very blessed. But talking with folks around here, a lot of people are not feeling so blessed. Veterans are struggling. The¬†rising cost¬†of living keeps everyone working extra hard to make ends meet. And everyday people just don‚Äôt feel like anyone‚Äôs listening to them.
The way¬†I¬†see it, Georgians work hard. But our hard work would go a lot farther if we had someone in Congress working to raise¬†Georgians‚Äô pay and lower costs, so everybody can have the tools and opportunities to build a good life. We should be building things here again, exporting American products instead of¬†American jobs, and growing our economy with more quality, good-paying jobs close to home here in¬†North¬†Georgia. We see our Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene on TV all the time, but she‚Äôs not talking about any of the things that matter to people around here. Instead of doing her job and working to fix the problems facing people here, she‚Äôs waving around naked pictures of Hunter Biden. And everywhere¬†I¬†go, people tell me they are troubled that her values do not align with ours. After 40 years of the military life, Karla and¬†I¬†have¬†been so happy back in the Georgia countryside. Karla sees patients, and¬†I¬†work around the¬†farm. When people first suggested¬†I¬†should run a campaign to unseat Marjorie Taylor Greene, it sounded a little crazy to us. But if my combat experience taught me anything, it‚Äôs that the way to make clear decisions is to make them free¬†of fear. The more Karla and¬†I¬†talked about it and what it¬†would¬†mean for our family and¬†our¬†community, the more it sounded like something we could do to help our¬†neighbors. And we‚Äôre always up for that.

That means listening to our neighbors, standing with our fellow Georgians, tackling the practical problems facing our communities, and making sure we are getting value back from the tax money we send to Washington. Shawn‚Äôs vision for a stronger northwest Georgia includes: Access to Quality Healthcare - Including Specialists Affordable preventive care and medications are foundational for healthy families and communities Recruit specialists closer than Atlanta or Chattanooga to handle emergencies and avoid the added travel costs and time away from work and family Mothers with high-risk pregnancies are in extra danger due to a lack of nearby OB-GYN‚Äôs Support mental health and substance abuse services to help families in rural communities When it comes to abortion, I support restoring the protections and restrictions we had under Roe v Wade. Politicians need to respect Americans‚Äô freedom to make our own decisions about our own families. I fully support the use of medical marijuana.¬† I know a lot of veterans who use it successfully for pain management. I also support removing it from the controlled substances list at the federal level and will work with state leadership to better define its use and dispensary access in GA. Infrastructure Investment For Good-Paying Jobs North Georgia has plenty of hard-working men and women ‚Äì what we need is better job opportunities, closer to home, which means we need our leaders to work to bring more federal and private-sector investment here We must stand up for working people and protect people‚Äôs rights in the workplace Develop all our secondary roads to be paved and safe Agriculture,  the Farm Bill and Natural Resources Pass the Farm Bill and fully fund it Protect¬† children and households in need by making sure full SNAP benefits are available. Expand¬† water infrastructure to accommodate both farmers and factories. Ensure all farmers have access to emerging production technologies. Expanded Broadband Access Provide¬† reliable broadband access to keep our rural communities from falling behind Broadband access is not just for commerce or education, it opens up remote work opportunities and keeps talented people from moving out of the countryside in search of opportunity Wraparound Services for Our Veterans No veteran should have to drive to Atlanta or Chattanooga for care from a specialist There is an ongoing mental health crisis in our veteran community, and we need reliable, accessible care to address the pain many of our combat veterans aren‚Äôt able to leave behind Provide¬† training programs focused on the skills military men and women learned while serving our country Support for Law Enforcement and Public Safety Support full funding for law enforcement to provide appropriate staffing to reduce response times, bolster clearance rates and handle dangerous situations safely We need to respect and provide for our law enforcement, first responder and corrections personnel, who do dangerous jobs for the benefit of all. That includes fully funding training, including de-escalation training for front-line police and corrections personnel, as well as tools to work with community members with mental health issues We must fully support the rights of law-abiding citizens to own guns to hunt and protect themselves, and also support our law enforcement with common-sense safety measures like background checks and red-flag laws Lowering Household Costs Expand price negotiations with pharma companies for Medicare, Medicaid and exchange health plans. Support anti-price-gouging legislation to keep profitable companies for arbitrarily raising prices on captive customers. Fund more affordable broadband access to open up remote work, educational and cultural opportunities and keep our rural communities from falling behind. Protecting Our Homeland Congress should do its job and fix our broken immigration laws to make sure our border is fully protected and we have a workable legal immigration system that serves the needs of American farmers, workers and businesses. Congress should expand asylum processing and tighten standards to stop the catch-and-release process that allows migrants into our country with no oversight or vetting. We must increase screening capacity at our ports and make emergency narcan available to prevent fentanyl and other opioids from killing Americans. We must strategically manage our relationship with foreign competitors like China to secure our intellectual and other property and avoid economic dependence. Leading A Stable, Peaceful World America must use all the tools we have to prevent and manage threats from overseas like China and Russia, including diplomacy, foreign civilian and military aid, cyber actions, and direct force projection. America should work to expand the Abraham Accords and bring in more partner countries to expand prosperity and set the stage for peace in the Middle East. When dictators invade neighboring countries, we should support those who resist them, to defend free people, to curb the power of threatening actors, to discourage other would-be invaders from following suit, and to protect American lives.

Shawn is For Team Georgia Shawn believes that more important than being on Team Red or Team Blue is being on Team Georgia ‚Äî squarely on the side of hard-working Georgians trying to build a good life. That means listening to our neighbors, standing with our fellow Georgians, tackling the practical problems facing our communities, and making sure we are getting value back from the tax money we send to Washington. Shawn‚Äôs vision for a stronger northwest Georgia includes: Access to Quality Healthcare - Including Specialists Affordable preventive care and medications are foundational for healthy families and communities Recruit specialists closer than Atlanta or Chattanooga to handle emergencies and avoid the added travel costs and time away from work and family Mothers with high-risk pregnancies are in extra danger due to a lack of nearby OB-GYN‚Äôs Support mental health and substance abuse services to help families in rural communities When it comes to abortion, I support restoring the protections and restrictions we had under Roe v Wade. Politicians need to respect Americans‚Äô freedom to make our own decisions about our own families.

Infrastructure Investment For Good-Paying Jobs North Georgia has plenty of hard-working men and women ‚Äì what we need is better job opportunities, closer to home, which means we need our leaders to work to bring more federal and private-sector investment here We must stand up for working people and protect people‚Äôs rights in the workplace Develop all our secondary roads to be paved and safe Agriculture,  the Farm Bill and Natural Resources Pass the Farm Bill and fully fund it Protect¬† children and households in need by making sure full SNAP benefits are available. Expand¬† water infrastructure to accommodate both farmers and factories. Ensure all farmers have access to emerging production technologies. Expanded Broadband Access Provide¬† reliable broadband access to keep our rural communities from falling behind Broadband access is not just for commerce or education, it opens up remote work opportunities and keeps talented people from moving out of the countryside in search of opportunity Wraparound Services for Our Veterans No veteran should have to drive to Atlanta or Chattanooga for care from a specialist There is an ongoing mental health crisis in our veteran community, and we need reliable, accessible care to address the pain many of our combat veterans aren‚Äôt able to leave behind Provide¬† training programs focused on the skills military men and women learned while serving our country Support for Law Enforcement and Public Safety Support full funding for law enforcement to provide appropriate staffing to reduce response times, bolster clearance rates and handle dangerous situations safely We need to respect and provide for our law enforcement, first responder and corrections personnel, who do dangerous jobs for the benefit of all. That includes fully funding training, including de-escalation training for front-line police and corrections personnel, as well as tools to work with community members with mental health issues We must fully support the rights of law-abiding citizens to own guns to hunt and protect themselves, and also support our law enforcement with common-sense safety measures like background checks and red-flag laws Lowering Household Costs Expand price negotiations with pharma companies for Medicare, Medicaid and exchange health plans. Support anti-price-gouging legislation to keep profitable companies for arbitrarily raising prices on captive customers. Fund more affordable broadband access to open up remote work, educational and cultural opportunities and keep our rural communities from falling behind. Protecting Our Homeland Congress should do its job and fix our broken immigration laws to make sure our border is fully protected and we have a workable legal immigration system that serves the needs of American farmers, workers and businesses. Congress should expand asylum processing and tighten standards to stop the catch-and-release process that allows migrants into our country with no oversight or vetting. We must increase screening capacity at our ports and make emergency narcan available to prevent fentanyl and other opioids from killing Americans. We must strategically manage our relationship with foreign competitors like China to secure our intellectual and other property and avoid economic dependence. Leading A Stable, Peaceful World America must use all the tools we have to prevent and manage threats from overseas like China and Russia, including diplomacy, foreign civilian and military aid, cyber actions, and direct force projection. America should work to expand the Abraham Accords and bring in more partner countries to expand prosperity and set the stage for peace in the Middle East. When dictators invade neighboring countries, we should support those who resist them, to defend free people, to curb the power of threatening actors, to discourage other would-be invaders from following suit, and to protect American lives.

The campaign cares about your privacy rights, and about providing you with the information you need in order to protect them. Accordingly, we‚Äôve created this policy to explain our privacy practices. This applies to https://www.shawnforgeorgia.com/ only.
We may revise and update this policy if our practices change, if we add new features to the site, or if we change existing ones that affect these practices. We may also modify this policy if we find better ways to inform you of products or services that we think will be of interest. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information.
We collect a variety of personal information about those who register on our site, make contributions through our site or use other functions or features on the site. Personal information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, credit card information, bank account information, e-mail address, or information about activities that are directly linked to that person.
We collect information you give us when you register on our site, contact us or make an online contribution. For example, when making a contribution, in addition to providing us your name, address, occupation and name of employer, you will need to provide us a billing address and credit card or bank account information, and answer a series of brief questions to make sure we may legally accept your contribution.
You may make changes to the information you have provided by visiting any form throughout the https://www.shawnforgeorgia.com/ site. You may also contact us at info@shawnforgeorgia.com with any questions or changes to your account.
Automatically Collected Information: We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us online.

Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent will not be shared with any third parties unless required by law.
We employ a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information.

To Protect You and Ourselves. We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena), to protect our rights or property, or to protect our donors and supporters from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful conduct, or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
