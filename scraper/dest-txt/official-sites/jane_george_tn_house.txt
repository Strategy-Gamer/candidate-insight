We find ourselves at a crossroads as legislators and the courts abolish women's rights to reproductive healthcare access. NOW IS THE TIME to elect candidates who will fight for our rights!
My roots run deep in East Tennessee. I have seen so many changes over the years, and we sure have gone through some growing pains. My grandparents were in the first graduating class from Carter High School. In fact, as a child, I used to climb the trees and chase cows on their land where the Strawberry Plains exit off I-40 is located now. I learned to waterski barefoot and fish on Norris Lake where my Great Grandparents lived.
My Grandaddy was a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, and my Grandmother a Yellow Dog Democrat. I grew up with a family that believed the right to vote was hard won and an obligation for any American.
The political talk at my family's table growing up was full of passion, and often fierce disagreement -- but no one was ever asked to leave, called names, or told they were un-American. That dialogue taught me the importance of differing viewpoints. I hope to bring that back to Washington in Congress as your Representative.
I went off to college and studied science, earning both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in Biology. I also took advantage of the women's studies programs. Returning home to Knoxville, I started my small business and have always been engaged in the political process.
I have learned a lot about the ways Tennessee has become a place that is driven by corporate powers, not constituents. While big profits for the wealthy company owners increase, the living wage hasn't changed since July of 2009 for the workers. The price of a home and raising a family has definitely gone up since then, and that wage is set by the Federal government for the state of Tennessee. That's one fight I will take to Washington!
My passion lies in my desire to work to create a safe political space in which the voice of the people is heard, acknowledged, and represented at the highest levels of government. I want to be known as someone who stands up for victims of domestic abuse, not votes to support domestic abusers. Someone who fights the extremes of party politics, not joins them. Someone who brings a strong female voice to the floor of the House of Representatives, not someone who supports the silence and subjugation of women. Someone who will work for and be with the people of East Tennessee, not make a permanent home in Washington, D.C.
It's time for leaders who take the job seriously and do right for the people.
Our forefathers determined that the role of the government was not to impose a single religion, but to ensure that Americans could practice their faith safely and without fear of retaliation.  In East Tennessee we are guided by these principles of compassion, helping our friends and caring for our neighbors.
Your Family, whether it is the one you were born into or the one you created from your community, deserves the basics, like a living wage, access to quality healthcare and to feel safe in our public spaces, houses of worship and schools.
My family tree is full of good folks fighting for our freedom all the way back to the revolution.  It is a treasure I hold close to my heart and one worth defending!  I was raised to honor and respect it by exercising my right and obligation to vote, to speak freely without causing harm (my Daddy taught me that) and to serve my community.
Every day we turn on our TVs or scroll through our phones seeing nothing but a whole lot of anger, division and mud slinging in the political arena.  Personally, I think those in Congress should be earning their salary by actually getting things done for their constituents, not their big money, corporate donors. My values are your values, your faith, your family, your freedom, and your future.
It's time for change.

The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) is one of North America's largest and most diverse unions, with members in virtually every sector of the economy. UAW-represented workplaces range from multinational corporations, small manufacturers, and state and local governments to colleges, universities, hospitals, and private non-profit organizations. The UAW has more than 400,000 active members and 580,000 retired members.
The Tennessee AFL-CIO Labor Council represents approximately 37 international unions, 273 different local unions and affiliations with a membership of over 60,000 Tennesseans. Many different unions in the area fall under our umbrella. These locals are the true heart of the movement, partnering with state and community organizations and conducting campaigns at all levels of government to improve life for working families.
Since 1977, the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee (NOW PAC) has worked to elect more uncompromising feminists to the White House and Congress. NOW PAC’s aggressive grassroots organizing and early support for feminist candidates have been changing the faces of those elected to federal office.
NOW PAC only raises money from NOW members, so our political work is 100% grassroots.
United Campus Workers - CWA Local 3865 is Tennessee's higher education union for all faculty, staff, and graduate workers in the state. Since 2003, we have been affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, a nationwide union representing over 700,000 members in education, healthcare, public service,  communications, airlines and more. UCW-CWA is part of the national AFL-CIO and active in our local Central Labor Councils.
The National Women's Political Caucus is a multi-partisan grassroots organization dedicated to increasing women’s participation in the political process. NWPC recruits, trains, and supports pro-choice women candidates for elected and appointed offices at all levels of government.
We are the ERA Coalition and Fund for Women’s Equality (ERA Coalition Forward); a movement of movements. We convene a diverse coalition of nearly 300 partner organizations across the country, representing 80 million people.
Moms Demand Action is a grassroots movement of Americans fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence. They pass stronger gun laws and work to close the loopholes that jeopardize the safety of our families. They also work in communities and with business leaders to encourage a culture of responsible gun ownership. They know that gun violence is preventable, and they are committed to doing what it takes to keep families safe.
The purpose of the Tennessee College Democrats is to support the philosophy and the candidates of the Democratic Party at both the state and national levels. Furthermore, TNCD intends to support all efforts to increase the participation of college students in the Democratic Party.
Their mission is to empower feminists, who are the majority, and to win equality for women at the decision-making tables of the state, nation, and the world. The Feminist Majority promotes non-discrimination on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, religion, ethnicity, age, marital status, nation of origin, size or disability. The purpose of Feminist Majority is to promote equality for women and men, non-violence, reproductive health, peace, social justice and economic development and to enhance feminist participation in public policy.
The Committee to Protect Health Care, composed of over 20,000 doctors and advocates across the United States, fights to expand health care access, lower costs for patients, and protect reproductive rights. Using advocacy campaign tactics, we hold anti-health care politicians accountable and fight back against special interests that put profits before patients.
The Alliance for Retired Americans is a grassroots advocacy organization with 4.4 million members. Founded by the AFL-CIO in 2001, the Alliance now has 39 state alliances and members in every state.
The Alliance’s retiree activists are from all walks of life. We are former teachers, auto workers, state and federal government workers, construction workers, and community leaders united in the belief that every American deserves a secure and dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work.
