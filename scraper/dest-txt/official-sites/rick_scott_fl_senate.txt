THANK YOU FLORIDA!
Debbie Caught Lying About Support for Green New Deal
Senator Scott was raised in the Midwest by his mother, who worked several jobs to make ends meet, and adoptive father, a World War II veteran and truck driver. Senator Scott lived in public housing and got his first job at the age of seven and hasn’t stopped working since. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Ann, Scott joined the Navy, where he served active duty as a radar man aboard the USS Glover. He bought his first business, a donut shop, while still in college at the University of Missouri-Kansas City so his mom could have a job. Scott went on to run the world’s largest healthcare company and various other businesses until 2010 when he made the decision to run for Governor to change the direction Florida was headed in.
Senator Scott and his wife, Ann, have been married since they were 19. They have two daughters and seven grandchildren.
Senator Rick Scott served two terms as the 45th Governor of Florida from 2011-2019. He ran on jobs and while he pledged the state would add 700,000 jobs in 7 years, the state far exceeded the number and Florida businesses added more than 1.7 million jobs while he was Governor.
As Governor of Florida, he cut taxes every single year, more than 100 times in those eight years saving Florida families and businesses more than $10 billion.  He fought to make it harder for politicians to raise taxes and fees on families by proposing legislation that would require a 2/3 majority of the legislature to pass any increase. Not only did it pass the legislature, but voters overwhelmingly supported it when it also passed as a constitutional amendment in 2018.
While Governor, he worked every day to make Florida the best place to get a job, raise a family, and build a business. He cut burdensome regulations, fought to make sure Florida had a top education system and worked with law enforcement so families could live in safe communities. He secured teacher pay raises, supported law enforcement with critical investments and championed record investments in Florida’s transportation system and environment.
Rick Scott was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2018 and is currently serving his first term representing the state of Florida. In 2022, Senator Rick Scott’s office was recognized as the best constituent services in Congress.
Since he has been in Washington, Senator Scott has focused on making Washington work for Floridians. He has worked tirelessly on fighting to return money back to taxpayers and continuing to make it harder for politicians to raise taxes and fees on American families.
He is fighting to stop the reckless government spending and the devastating inflation it has caused in Florida and across our nation; take action to protect Social Security and Medicare and preserve the promise of these programs for our children and grandchildren; hold government accountable across all agencies ranging from the FBI to the IRS; combat the extreme danger posed by Communist China; secure our border and stop the flow of drugs, terrorism and illegal immigration into our country; and refocus our military on lethal defense instead of woke nonsense.
Last fall, he challenged Mitch McConnell for Leader to the Senate because he has been sick of watching Republicans continue to cave to Democrats and help them pass policies that hurt working families.  While he knew it would be an uphill battle, Senator Scott is willing to take on anyone – even in his own party – to make sure the right things happen for families.
Senator Scott is currently running for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2024 to continue fighting for Florida families, hold the Washington establishment and Democrats accountable and rescue America from the destruction caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats.

VIVIENDO EL SUEÑO AMERICANO
El senador Scott fue criado en el Medio Oeste de los EE. UU por su madre, quien tenía varios trabajos para cubrir los gastos del mes, y su padre adoptivo, un veterano de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y conductor de camiones. El senador Scott vivió en vivienda pública y tuvo su primer trabajo a los siete años y no ha dejado de trabajar desde entonces. Después de casarse con su novia de la escuela secundaria, Ann, Scott se unió a la Marina de Estado Unidos, donde estuvo en servicio activo como hombre de radar a bordo del USS Glover. Compró su primer negocio, una tienda de donas, mientras aún estaba en la universidad de Missouri-Kansas City para que su madre pudiera tener un trabajo. Scott pasó a dirigir la compañía de cuidado médico más grande del mundo y otros negocios hasta el 2010, cuando tomó la decisión de postularse para gobernador del estado y cambiar el rumbo de Florida.
El senador Scott y su esposa, Ann, han estado casados desde que tenían 19 años. Tienen dos hijas y siete nietos.
El senador Rick Scott sirvió dos términos como gobernador de Florida desde el 2011 hasta el 2019. Se postuló con una agenda para la creación de empleos y aunque prometió que el estado agregaría 700,000 empleos en 7 años, el estado superó en exceso el número y las empresas de la Florida agregaron más de 1.7 millones de empleos mientras él era gobernador.
Como gobernador de Florida, el redujo los impuestos cada año, más de 100 veces en esos ocho años, ahorrando a las familias y empresas de la Florida más de 10 mil millones de dólares. Luchó para prevenir que los políticos aumentaran los impuestos y las tasas a las familias, al proponer una ley que requeriría una mayoría de 2/3 de la legislatura para aprobar cualquier aumento de impuesto. No solo fue aprobada por la legislatura, sino que los votantes apoyaron masivamente la medida cuando también se propuso como una enmienda constitucional en el 2018.
Mientras era gobernador, trabajó todos los días para hacer de la  Florida el mejor estado para conseguir un trabajo, criar una familia y construir un negocio. Redujo las regulaciones onerosas, luchó para asegurarse de que la Florida tuviera un sistema educativo superior y trabajó con la policía para que las familias pudieran vivir en comunidades seguras. Aseguró aumentos salariales para maestros, apoyó a la policía con inversiones críticas y defendió inversiones récord en el sistema de transporte y el medio ambiente de la Florida.
HACER QUE WASHINGTON TRABAJE
Rick Scott fue electo al Senado de los Estados Unidos en el 2018 y actualmente está cumpliendo su primer mandato representando al estado de Florida.  En el 2022, la oficina del senador Rick Scott fue reconocida como la oficina con los mejores servicios a los constituyentes en el Senado de los Estado Unidos.
Desde que ha estado en Washington, el senador Scott se ha enfocado en hacer que Washington trabaje para los floridanos. Ha trabajado incansablemente en la lucha para devolverle dinero a los contribuyentes y para que los políticos no aumenten impuestos y tarifas a las familias americanas.
Está luchando para detener el gasto desmedido del gobierno, que ha causado la inflación devastadora en la Florida y en toda nuestra nación; ha tomado medidas para proteger el Seguro Social y Medicare y preservar la promesa de estos programas para nuestros hijos y nietos; responsabilizar al gobierno en todas las agencias, desde el FBI hasta el IRS; combatir el gran peligro que representa China comunista; asegurar nuestras fronteras y detener el flujo de drogas, terrorismo e inmigración ilegal a nuestro país; y reenfocar la prioridades de nuestras fuerzas armadas en una defensa letal en vez de las medidas descabezadas de los izquierdistas.
El año pasado retó a Mitch McConnell para líder del Senado porque está cansado de ver como republicanos continúan cediendo ante los demócratas, apoyándolos a aprobar políticas que perjudican a las familias trabajadoras.  Si bien sabía que sería una batalla cuesta arriba, el senador Scott está dispuesto a enfrentarse a cualquiera, incluso a su propio partido, para asegurarse de que hagan las cosas correctas para nuestras familias.
LUCHANDO PARA RESCATAR A ESTADOS UNIDOS
El senador Scott actualmente se está postulando para la reelección al Senado de los Estados Unidos en el 2024 para continuar luchando por las familias de Florida, frenar al establecimiento de Washington y a los demócratas, y rescatar a Estados Unidos de la destrucción causada por Joe Biden y los demócratas.

October 28, 2024 | News , Press Releases
TAMPA, Fla. – Debbie Mucarsel-Powell recently melted down when confronted about her socialist record and her support for the Green New Deal. According to Debbie, being a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal – the most radical bill in modern history – doesn’t count because it was “5 years ago.” In short, she is running from her record, and it doesn’t take much to debunk this blatant lie. She is listed as a cosponsor of the Green New Deal.
From Politico :
“Mucarsel-Powell told POLITICO this month, ‘I never signed onto the Green New Deal bill,’ despite being listed as a co-sponsor of H.R. 109 (116) , a 14-page resolution that outlined the the tenets of the proposal. Her campaign clarified that she did not support broader bill proposals later by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that also took on the moniker “Green New Deal.”
‘I can’t believe you’re asking me about the Green New Deal because that was 2019,” she told POLITICO. “That was five years ago.’”
Statement from Team Rick Scott Spokesman Jonathan Turcotte: “We know Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has a very limited understanding of how Congress works given her short tenure. But, when you co-sponsor a bill, it’s etched in the Congressional record forever. She co-sponsored the Green New Deal, aka the ‘Green Job Killer,’ 5 years ago and was promptly rejected by Floridians for her embrace of socialism. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is a silly socialist who lacks any credibility and thinks she can fool Floridians. Unfortunately for her, history doesn’t reset every 5 years – Floridians know her socialist voting record and will reject her again on November 5 th .”
