Gay Gillespie Valimont is a mother and gun violence prevention activist in Pensacola, Florida who has devoted her life to improving public safety. Gay earned a bachelor’s degree in Health and Exercise Science from Georgia Southern University, her National Athletic Trainers Association accreditation, and her M.A. in Education from Troy State University before pursuing her career in sports medicine in Atlanta.
There she worked for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and, later, Emory Sports Medicine as an athletic trainer. As Gay built relationships with her players, they told her about their fears around the everyday gun violence some experienced in their neighborhoods. She knew there had to be solutions that could keep her players and community safe and decided then that she couldn’t accept just sitting on the sidelines.
During her time in Atlanta, she met her husband Brian Valimont and started a family, giving birth to their son Eli in 2012. Together the family made the move to Pensacola for the incredible beaches and good public schools for Eli. While Gay couldn’t have been happier as a stay-at-home mother to Eli, she felt a pull to serve after the Sandy Hook School shooting unfolded and got involved.
She joined Moms Demand Action for Gunsense in America locally and stayed engaged, even when Brian’s job moved them to Naples. By 2016, Gay was a full-time grassroots activist and had worked her way up to Florida State Lead. Her decade of leadership in gun violence prevention helped to expand Florida’s Moms Demand Action Chapter by over 400%, engaging new volunteers and effectively pushing for legislative change.
In 2020, Gay faced the unimaginable when her husband Brian was diagnosed with ALS and a few months later their 8-year-old son Eli was diagnosed with DIPG, a rare and terminal brain tumor. Gay served as the primary caretaker for both until they passed away, within months of each other. She then returned to Pensacola – where her family was happiest – with more drive than ever and a knowledge that there’s no time to waste. Now Gay is running for Congress to bring compassion, integrity, and genuine representation to a district she deeply loves. Grounded in community, care, and unity, Gay believes in a brighter future for Florida.

Explore the key issues that drive her campaign and learn how she plans to create change.
While navigating the terminal illnesses of both her husband and son at the same time, Gay got a real-world education on the importance of accessibility and affordability of healthcare. Every person should have access to the care they need without wondering if they can afford to save their own life or the life of a loved one. Universal, affordable, quality health care must be a priority.
Gay will fight to:
Defend the Affordable Care Act
Reduce prescription costs
Ensure that all Americans have access to quality doctors, preventative health care, and treatment for their physical and mental health
Gay has an unwavering commitment to the largest military population in Florida who proudly call District 1 home. Her step-father was a disabled Navy veteran and knows first hand the struggle VA care can be. Gay also recognizes our military bases as vital components of our community with value that extends well beyond their military functions as they bolster local economies across the district, generating jobs and fostering growth. We must and will protect our military and veterans.
Gay will fight for:
Comprehensive mental health care for past, current, and future veterans
Legislation that guarantees veterans have easily accessible and cost-effective healthcare choices
Initiatives that facilitate veterans’ transition to civilian careers and bring improvements to the G.I Bill
Strategies to prevent and address veteran homelessness, including providing access to transitional housing and supportive services
Environmental measures to safeguard our bases against natural disasters.
Obtain Federal funding for a full VA hospital for District 1
We must ensure that all American children have access to the best education possible, no matter their socioeconomic status. This begins with providing high-quality, affordable pre-kindergarten education for all children nationwide, offering a strong start to their academic journey. Gay is committed to ensuring fair and equal access to accurate educational materials. She believes in creating safe environments in our schools, where all children can learn without fear of discrimination.
Gay will fight to:
Increase funding for public schools, with a focus on schools in low-income areas to reduce disparities in educational resources
Provide educators with competitive salaries and professional development resources
Ensure students have ample opportunities to pursue higher education without the burden of a lifetime of debt
Florida is currently experiencing a housing crisis. Soaring housing and insurance costs have caused homelessness to skyrocket, particularly among our most vulnerable citizens like seniors and veterans. Despite laws prohibiting renting and lending discrimination, people of color continue to face barriers to home ownership and rentals. All Americans must have access to safe and stable housing.
Gay will fight to:
Incentivize the construction of affordable housing
Expand rental assistance for low-income families
Close the racial homeownership gap
Support legislation like the Place to Prosper Act – which would reduce rent increases, make evictions more difficult, and ban source of income discrimination
The preservation of our coastlines through proven environmental protection measures is essential to safeguard Florida’s natural beauty and diverse ecosystems that attract tourists, support our local businesses, and make up our homes. Florida is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise and more frequent hurricanes.
Gay will fight to:
Invest in clean energy infrastructures
Conserve public lands and natural habitats
Prioritize clean water initiatives and enforce regulations to prevent pollution in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas
Address climate resilience through infrastructure investments, flood control measures, and coastal protections
A thriving democracy is built on the principle that every eligible citizen’s voice should be heard. Gay will strive to create a more inclusive, equitable, and robust democracy where every eligible voter can exercise their right to vote, participate fully in our political process, and have confidence in the integrity of our elections. Together, we will build a stronger, more representative democracy that reflects the will of the people.
Gay will fight to:
Defend and strengthen the Voting Rights Act to prevent discriminatory voting practices and protect vulnerable communities from voter disenfranchisement
Invest in election security measures to protect our democracy from foreign interference and misinformation
Reform campaign finance regulations to reduce the influence of big money in politics and amplify the voices of everyday citizens
Institute automatic universal voter registration for all eligible citizens upon turning 18, as well as same-day voter registration and online registration to eliminate barriers to participation
All Americans deserve to live full, free, healthy lives. We must ensure that all people, including women, minorities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ+ Americans, and Indigenous persons have equal access to housing and healthcare, educational opportunities, access to credit, and safe working conditions. All aspects of our government must be committed to the rule of law and equal protection for all Americans.
Gay will fight for:
Access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare and the right to choose
Equal pay for equal work and closing the gender pay gap
Policies that address racial and ethnic disparities in education, criminal justice, and economic opportunities
Ensuring LGBTQ+ rights through anti-discrimination measures
Upholding disability rights through accessible infrastructure and inclusive policies
Supporting labor unions to protect workers' rights, ensure fair wages, and secure safe working conditions
Gun violence is a deadly public health crisis that demands action. With more than 120 gun fatalities occurring every day, we cannot rely on thoughts and prayers alone. To address this crisis, we must take immediate and comprehensive steps at the national level. At the core of our strategy is legislation to strengthen background checks for all gun purchases, a critical measure to keep firearms out of the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers, and violent criminals.
Gay will fight for:
Universal Background Checks on ALL gun sales to close existing loopholes and ensure every sale includes a thorough background check
Strengthening and expanding Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), commonly known as Red Flag Laws, to empower concerned family members and law enforcement
Making sure provisions from President Biden’s Safer Communities Act are enforced. Including closing the dangerous “boyfriend loophole” that allows individuals convicted of abusing their dating partners to legally retain registered firearms
Investing in evidence-based Community-Based Violence Prevention programs and initiatives.
