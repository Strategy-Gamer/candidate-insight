America has seen a record-high number of border crossings thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration's open border policies. Our nation is under siege by millions of illegal immigrants and tragically, the crisis of fentanyl pouring in through our southern border is enough to kill every American.
Laurie Buckhout is a STRONG advocate for securing our border by building the wall and reimplementing the “Remain in Mexico” policies of the Trump Administration.
The Biden-Harris-Davis agenda created devastating inflation rates and made the cost of living unaffordable in Eastern North Carolina. Laurie will fight for working families who can’t afford another year of rising costs at the gas pump and grocery store.
As a small business owner, Laurie Buckhout knows what it takes to balance a budget and create American jobs. Rural communities like ours have seen the devastating effects of outsourcing good jobs. Laurie will fight to bring back jobs here in rural communities.
Laurie Buckhout is no stranger to defending herself, her loved ones, and her country. As a combat veteran, Laurie understands the vital importance of the right to keep and bear arms. She will stand strong against the extremists who mock our hunting heritage and would punish law-abiding gun owners with additional red tape.
America has the greatest fighting force in the world, but we must fight to keep it that way. A strong and ready military deters American enemies and establishes peace here at home. Laurie is committed to investing in our nation’s military to continue asserting our dominance over all threats, foreign and domestic. The United States must have the strength by all means necessary to protect us from countries like China, Iran, and Russia and to defend our allies like Israel.
Our troops make immense sacrifices while bravely serving our nation. They deserve a strong leader in Congress who will fight to ensure they receive the very best care when their mission is complete. Laurie’s promise to fellow veterans does not end when they return home, she will not rest until our veterans receive the proper care they deserve.
