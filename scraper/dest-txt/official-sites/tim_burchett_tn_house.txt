Tim Burchett is a lifelong East Tennessee conservative, a husband, a dad, and the Republican Congressman for Congress in Tennessee’s 2nd Congressional District. He ran for Congress because he was fed up with the status quo in our nation’s Capitol.
Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tim attended Bearden High School before earning his Bachelor’s degree in education from the University of Tennessee.
Dedicated to serving his community, Tim has spent much of his adult life serving the people of East Tennessee. In the state legislature, Tim sponsored and supported many bills, cutting taxes, protecting American Jobs, and defending the God-given liberties of Tennesseans.
In 2010, Tim was sworn into office as Knox County mayor. As mayor, he has focused on true conservative leadership by limiting the scope of government. He defeated a massive property tax proposal, cut the county’s debt by $45 million, and fought to protect local small businesses.
Tim always stands for what is right, no matter the political cost. Tim is a proven leader who gets the job done and puts the best interests of Tennesseans ahead of petty partisanship and personal gain.
His commitment to working hard and his determination to do the right thing came from his parents, Charlie and Joyce Burchett. Charlie and Joyce grew up during the Depression, served their country and were both career educators. Tim’s father fought under Col. Chesty Puller in the Pacific during World War II. Tim’s mother learned to fly an airplane in support of the war effort, an uncommon feat for a woman in the 1940s.
Tim is also a former small businessman who started his own business, converting over 30 thousand tons of grass waste into mulch and compost. He ran a truck and trailer business. He knows firsthand how much our small businesses struggle with government regulations and incomprehensible red tape.
Tim lives in Knoxville with his wife, Kelly, and their daughter, Isabel, who has given Tim the title of “best crawdad catcher in North America.”
As the divide between Washington politicians and their constituents continues to grow, Tim wants to do what he’s always done – fight for East Tennessee. He wants to fight for the families, the factory workers, and the small business owners who make this country great. Join him.

Veterans make up one percent of our population, but we owe them 100 percent of our freedoms. Tim is proud to come from a family of veterans and service. His dad was a Marine who served in the Pacific during World War II, and his uncle died fighting the Nazis in France. The most important thing we can do as a nation is to honor our veterans and make sure they get the care they need and deserve.
It’s unacceptable that our veterans have to drive three hours to Johnson City to get to the nearest VA hospital, and even there, the care is suspect. After the VA scandal, Congress passed new reforms, but the Veterans Administration still has too much control over our veterans’ care, and veterans are still hamstrung by red tape and bureaucracy. Vets should have the choice to get care wherever they choose.
Tim has worked to support veterans throughout his time in office and is committed to continuing this work as congressman. As mayor, he expanded services for veterans and launched an initiative to better serve veterans suffering from combat-related issues, including PTSD. Tim also spearheaded Wreaths Across America, which raises money to honor veterans’ cemeteries in Knox County.

There’s no question about it: The longer politicians stay in Washington, the more beholden they become to the special-interests who line their pockets. The Founding Fathers never intended for people to go to Washington and make a career out of it. Tim sponsored term limits legislation in Tennessee and has pledged to support term limits legislation as a member of Congress. You can’t clean up Washington with dirty career politicians.

Our federal government already taxes and spends too much. The last thing we need to do is raise more taxes and spend more of America’s hard-earned money. Tim supports a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution that will force the big spenders in Washington to live within their means and make it harder for them to raise taxes. We need to root out the waste and corruption that allows the special interests to secure wasteful projects and programs on the backs of taxpayers.
Tim has been an anti-tax champion throughout his time in public office. As a state legislator, he earned the “Tax Ax” award for fighting off the state income tax. As mayor of Knox County, Tim refused to budge when special interests tried to raise our property taxes. He successfully killed one of the largest tax increases in county history, and refused to raise taxes throughout his eight-year tenure. Tim also introduced fiscally responsible budgets that built up Knox County’s reserves for tough times. He saved taxpayers millions of dollars by introducing efficiencies in government, getting rid of waste even in his own office, selling government buildings, and privatizing services government had no business offering in the first place.
