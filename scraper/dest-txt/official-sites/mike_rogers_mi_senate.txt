Michigan’s way of life is worth defending. That’s why I served in the Army. That’s why I served in the FBI taking down organized crime. That’s why I led the House Intelligence Committee in the hard years after 9/11.
But we can all feel that something is broken.
America under Biden and his cronies is going in the wrong direction. Our border is wide open, our justice system is broken, and Biden’s bad policies are making everything more expensive.
With your help, we’ll get America back on track.
Politics has gotten so small and petty, that we’re failing to address big problems. We can do better. That’s why Mike is running for the United States Senate.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELISSA SLOTKIN  ➤
Despite insisting she won’t let politics get in the way, Slotkin is among the most partisan members of the U.S. House. During Biden’s first two years in office, Slotkin voted with Biden 100 percent of the time , supporting his inflationary spending that exploded the debt and skyrocketed the cost of everyday goods like food, groceries, and rent . Thanks to Slotkin’s votes, the dollar has lost 20 percent of its value , crushing families. Further, Slotkin has been in office since 2019, yet she has only passed a single bill , which renamed a post office in Holly, MI .
Elissa Slotkin fully supports Joe Biden’s electric vehicle mandates, voting against a bipartisan bill that would have prohibited the EPA from banning gas-powered vehicles. These mandates are set to enrich China , slash Michigan auto jobs by up to 40 percent , take choices away from Americans, and endanger national security .
Slotkin’s anti-American energy agenda even led to her voting to ban gas stoves from American households.
Elissa Slotkin secretly signed a non-disclosure agreement with the MEDC in order to coordinate with the Chinese company Gotion and provided hundreds of millions of Michigan taxpayer dollars in order to bribe the company to build a plant in northern Michigan. The plant in Big Rapids is within 75 miles of a U.S. military base in Grayling.
Gotion pledges its allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party, and its founder is a member of the Chinese Communist Party and is known to work with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping .
Despite massive national security concerns and local opposition, Slotkin has not retracted her support, nor explained her reasoning for signing this agreement .
On the Lansing City Pulse Podcast in June 2018, Slotkin said that she was “proud” that Mike Rogers was her congressman “back home,” citing Mike’s national security credentials and his engagement with constituents. Slotkin stated that “ I would never be running in this race if Mike Rogers were the congressman. ” She continued: “ I don’t have to agree with everything he believed in to know that he was working hard for the district .”
Elissa Slotkin is a strong proponent of ‘Squad’ member Rashida Tlaib, despite Tlaib’s incessant support for terrorist group Hamas. Tlaib has consistently gone out of her way to spread antisemitism and hatred towards our ally Israel. Elissa Slotkin however refuses to condemn Tlaib, and even calls her a “ badass. ”
Elissa Slotkin has a long track record of voting against border security . Year after year, Slotkin votes against bipartisan efforts to secure the border, instead voting with Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi to give Covid relief checks to illegal immigrants , and even voted to give amnesty to illegals and against constructing the border wall . In May 2024, Slotkin voted to count illegal immigrants in the Census to benefit Democrats.
Elissa Slotkin was born in New York, NY, received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, and received her graduate degree from Columbia University in New York, NY.
In spring 2017, after two decades living out of the state of Michigan, Slotkin moved to Oakland County, MI to run for Congress in Michigan’s 8th district. Knowing she was carpetbagging, Slotkin set up a fake business in order to call herself a small business owner. The company never had any revenue , and has not been in ‘good standing’ since 2020 , resulting in Slotkin owing fines to the State of Michigan.
Following redistricting in 2022, Slotkin’s residence in Oakland County was drawn into a new district held by Republican Lisa McClain. In order to run for a more favorable district, Slotkin signed a temporary lease that expired in November 2022 with Jerry Hollister, a Lansing-based lobbyist and donor to Slotkin’s campaigns , so she could run in MI-07 with a Lansing, MI address.
Despite promising to voters that she would buy a house in MI-07 following the election, she instead moved her registration back to her residence in Oakland County, MI .
This strange relationship is a clear example of further carpetbagging by Elissa Slotkin. ( PDF )
Elissa Slotkin hired Fay Beydoun , a prominent liberal fundraiser to serve on her campaign’s finance team . In April 2024, Beydoun came under heavy criticism for extensive mishandling of taxpayer money that she received as part of a grant from the Whitmer administration. This includes a $4,500 coffee maker , $11,000 for a flight to Budapest , and salaries worth hundreds of thousands of dollars . Slotkin has yet to condemn this theft of taxpayer dollars by one of her top advisors.
In 2017, Slotkin’s Deputy Political Director, Terra Defoe, posted on Facebook a photo of herself with noted antisemite Louis Farrakhan while she attended the 2017 Savior’s Day Convention .

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELISSA SLOTKIN  ➤
Service, that is what has defined the life of Mike Rogers. Mike was born and raised in Livingston County, Michigan. His parents were leaders in the community, his dad was a teacher, a coach, and a vice principal, and his mother led the local chamber of commerce, fighting for small businesses. After graduating from Howell High School and Adrian College, Mike began his service to the American people as a lieutenant in the United States Army. Following his time in the Army, Mike continued serving his country as a Special Agent in the FBI, taking down organized crime and public corruption in Chicago. Seeing this corrupt activity firsthand, Mike knew that people of character were required to step up and serve. Mike’s idea of public service has always been to serve others, not yourself. In 1994, Mike decided it was time to run for the Michigan Senate and to serve his community as their voice in the legislature. As a State Senator, Mike worked to help families stay safe and succeed. He wrote the legislation that created Michigan’s 529 College Savings Program, helping families save for their children’s education. Mike also fought to reduce burdensome regulations that were harming our small businesses and worked with law enforcement to get them the new tools they needed to take down child predators. In 2000, Mike ran to represent Michigan in Congress, defeating his Democrat opponent in the closest race in the country that year. In Congress, Mike worked to eliminate federal taxes on education savings plans and passed legislation to help low-income families receive healthcare. Mike also authored the Respect for Fallen Heroes Act, which made protesting on federal land while families were burying service members who made the ultimate sacrifice a federal crime. On the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mike worked to secure our nations’ energy independence and unleash American made energy by reducing the regulations and tax burdens on American families and small businesses.
Mike made his greatest mark in Congress through his service as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He was among the first to sound the alarm on the economic and national security danger posed by China. Mike also fought Chinese efforts to steal American intellectual property, particularly working to protect Michigan’s auto industry. In 2015, Mike entered the private sector, creating a business where he became a champion for American innovation, passionately helping the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. Mike is also passionate about the field of cyber security, working with companies large and small to protect their data from criminals and bad-acting countries like China.
Mike is happily married to his wife Kristi, who has also lived a life of service. She served in Iraq as a liaison for the Department of Defense and worked to secure our borders with the Customs and Border Protection Agency. Service is instilled in their family. Mike’s daughter served in AmeriCorps after college, helping armed service members get access to the care they need. His son, the 4th generation of the Rogers family to serve in the U.S. military, is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and is currently serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy.
Mike Rogers has always answered the call to serve, and he is ready to serve Michigan in the United States Senate.

His parents were leaders in the community, his dad was a teacher, a coach, and a vice principal, and his mother led the local chamber of commerce, fighting for small businesses. After graduating from Howell High School and Adrian College, Mike began his service to the American people as a lieutenant in the United States Army. Following his time in the Army, Mike continued serving his country as a Special Agent in the FBI, taking down organized crime and public corruption in Chicago. Seeing this corrupt activity firsthand, Mike knew that people of character were required to step up and serve. Mike’s idea of public service has always been to serve others, not yourself. In 1994, Mike decided it was time to run for the Michigan Senate and to serve his community as their voice in the legislature. As a State Senator, Mike worked to help families stay safe and succeed. He wrote the legislation that created Michigan’s 529 College Savings Program, helping families save for their children’s education. Mike also fought to reduce burdensome regulations that were harming our small businesses and worked with law enforcement to get them the new tools they needed to take down child predators. In 2000, Mike ran to represent Michigan in Congress, defeating his Democrat opponent in the closest race in the country that year. In Congress, Mike worked to eliminate federal taxes on education savings plans and passed legislation to help low-income families receive healthcare. Mike also authored the Respect for Fallen Heroes Act, which made protesting on federal land while families were burying service members who made the ultimate sacrifice a federal crime. On the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mike worked to secure our nations’ energy independence and unleash American made energy by reducing the regulations and tax burdens on American families and small businesses. Mike made his greatest mark in Congress through his service as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He was among the first to sound the alarm on the economic and national security danger posed by China. Mike also fought Chinese efforts to steal American intellectual property, particularly working to protect Michigan’s auto industry. In 2015, Mike entered the private sector, creating a business where he became a champion for American innovation, passionately helping the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. Mike is also passionate about the field of cyber security, working with companies large and small to protect their data from criminals and bad-acting countries like China. Mike is happily married to his wife Kristi, who has also lived a life of service. She served in Iraq as a liaison for the Department of Defense and worked to secure our borders with the Customs and Border Protection Agency. Service is instilled in their family. Mike’s daughter served in AmeriCorps after college, helping armed service members get access to the care they need. His son, the 4th generation of the Rogers family to serve in the U.S. military, is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and is currently serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy. Mike Rogers has always answered the call to serve, and he is ready to serve Michigan in the United States Senate.

This morning, Mike Rogers joined Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo to discuss the state of the race in Michigan and why Slotkin should release herself from her secret agreement before November 5.
In case you missed it , Mike Rogers earned another major endorsement over the weekend, this time from the Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi. Mayor Bazzi immigrated from Lebanon at the age of 10 and lived in Dearborn before joining the United States Marine Corps. He is the first Muslim Mayor of Dearborn Heights.
In case you missed it , Mike Rogers penned an op-ed in the The Detroit News on how the Harris-Slotkin EV mandates negatively impact Michigan’s auto industry and national security.

Mike Rogers, along with voters from across Michigan, are calling on Slotkin to release herself from her non-disclosure agreement in the final 12 days of the Michigan Senate race, the closest in America.
The efforts include an onslaught of grassroots supporters exposing Slotkin for her dodging, signed petitions, op-eds, letters to the editor, press conferences, and more.
HARRIS FREAK OUT — The Harris campaign is freaking out, roadmapping scenarios where they don’t win Michigan — For good reason as President Trump leads in the polls, well above his polling average in 2020, and traditional Democrat coalitions continue to fray.
Mike Rogers penned an op-ed in Washington Reporter laying out his reasons for running to represent Michigan in the U.S. Senate, touching on the rising prices for gas and groceries, stopping EV mandates, and protecting Michiganders.

Michigan’s way of life is worth defending. That’s why I served in the Army. That’s why I served in the FBI taking down organized crime. That’s why I led the House Intelligence Committee in the hard years after 9/11.
But we can all feel that something is broken.
America under Biden and his cronies is going in the wrong direction. Our border is wide open, our justice system is broken, and Biden’s bad policies are making everything more expensive.
With your help, we’ll get America back on track.
Politics has gotten so small and petty, that we’re failing to address big problems. We can do better. That’s why Mike is running for the United States Senate.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ELISSA SLOTKIN  ➤
A version of this piece was published in The Messenger Opinion, 17 May 2023
Unless we make a change in 2024 and take the challenge that China represents seriously, we will lose in this era of strategic competition. We on a path that will see the most profound geopolitical defeat in our country’s history, not through invasion or by force of arms, but through the erosion of American power. The consequences of this defeat are ones from which our country may never recover and never return, but will look longingly at today, which will be seen as halcyon days by comparison.
A world where China wins is one where America’s fate is not in its own hands. The decisions of Beijing and the Chinese Communist Party will have far greater impact than those of Washington. The hands of the president and Congress are tied; their powers circumscribed by Beijing’s actions on the international stage. This is not idle speculation or alarmism but stated goal of the Chinese Communist Party. China wants to recapture what it views as its lost position of greatness after a “century of humiliation”.
A world in which China wins is wholly alien to Americans today.
A world in which China wins will see the dominance of the dollar ended. An increasing number of countries are accepting the yuan in lieu of the dollar—Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina, for example. The relative stability of America’s markets is upended as the dollar is replaced by the yuan. Interest rates will be far higher than today and the cost of borrowing money prohibitively expensive. Americans purchasing power at home and abroad will erode.
A world in which China sets the international rules for trade is one in which companies and businesses do not compete on an even playing field. The Chinese Communist Party will put its hands on the scales, tipping them in favor of Chinese businesses. The United States has filed nearly 30 cases with the World Trade Organization about China’s unfair practices, and won every single one, yet Beijing still refuses to play by the rules.
A China that controls the supply chains for critical minerals and rare earth elements is one that dominates future industries. Today, Beijing accounts for over 60% of the world’s rare earth mining and 85% of its processing. The vital components for the green revolution are wholly in Beijing’s hands, giving it profound leverage while the world works to shift from fossil fuels to advanced batteries. It can simply turn off the taps whenever it wants, or merely threaten that very supply to ensure compliance with its interests.
Chinese dominance means its apps and tools are in the hands of every American, affording Beijing unparalleled access to every citizen. With apps like TikTok, which already has 150 million users in America, China can censor what our citizens see, ensuring that only Party approved messages a viewed by Americans—it is ubiquitous stealth censorship and the direct erosion of our democracy. A dominant China will promote those who agree with it and denigrate those who run afoul of the Party’s platform.
A dominant China is one that pushes America out of the Indo-Pacific and bullies its neighbors, and one that retakes Taiwan by force. China now has the world’s largest navy , with 355 ships at sea, and rising. America’s one-time allies will look elsewhere for security and reassurance, pursuing their own defense policies and creating more instability, not less. In this world, America’s military is a paper tiger, hollowed out, and unable to defend our national interests.
This is a future we can avoid if we act today and take the challenge seriously. It means the smart and judicious application of power abroad and the reinvigoration of our democratic republic at home. It means jettisoning the sugar-high politics of confrontation and celebrity and rising above our petty politics.
It means getting our fiscal house in order. In 2022, China held $981 billion of our debt, exposing us to unacceptable levels of risk. We cannot afford to spend as recklessly as we do on outdated and inefficient programs that cost more each year and deliver less to our citizens. Reducing our borrowing from China and strengthening our economy at home will create greater stability in both foreign and domestic markets, giving greater confidence in the dollar and enhancing its competitiveness. This means modernizing government, which will lead to smaller, better, and more efficient government.
This means ending China’s campaign of industrial espionage of the next generation of technology. The scale of this campaign is staggering: right now, the FBI opens a counterespionage case every 10 hours. It means putting a stop to the Chinese Communist Party’s unfettered access to our country’s best and brightest education and research institutions.
It means outcompeting China. This means re-engaging with our allies and partners in international forums. It means mobilizing American business. It means unleashing American innovation, not constraining it for narrow social agendas. It means securing deals with our allies and partners based on the rule of law. In our own hemisphere, China’s reach has rapidly expanded —over 20 countries participate in Beijing’s One Belt, One Road development initiative, and over 15% of Latin America’s exports go to China, up from 1% at the turn of the century. We need to get back out onto the playing field and make American businesses more competitive.
An America in charge of its own destiny is one that limits the unfettered access to and manipulation of our democracy. It means taking a much closer look at investments, apps, and technology from China and being unafraid to use the powers of government protect the American people.
We must win in this contest against China, but more importantly we can if we act now.

The consequences of this defeat are ones from which our country may never recover and never return, but will look longingly at today, which will be seen as halcyon days by comparison. A world where China wins is one where America’s fate is not in its own hands. The decisions of Beijing and the Chinese Communist Party will have far greater impact than those of Washington. The hands of the president and Congress are tied; their powers circumscribed by Beijing’s actions on the international stage. This is not idle speculation or alarmism but stated goal of the Chinese Communist Party. China wants to recapture what it views as its lost position of greatness after a “century of humiliation”. A world in which China wins is wholly alien to Americans today. A world in which China wins will see the dominance of the dollar ended. An increasing number of countries are accepting the yuan in lieu of the dollar—Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina, for example. The relative stability of America’s markets is upended as the dollar is replaced by the yuan. Interest rates will be far higher than today and the cost of borrowing money prohibitively expensive. Americans purchasing power at home and abroad will erode. A world in which China sets the international rules for trade is one in which companies and businesses do not compete on an even playing field. The Chinese Communist Party will put its hands on the scales, tipping them in favor of Chinese businesses. The United States has filed nearly 30 cases with the World Trade Organization about China’s unfair practices, and won every single one, yet Beijing still refuses to play by the rules. A China that controls the supply chains for critical minerals and rare earth elements is one that dominates future industries. Today, Beijing accounts for over 60% of the world’s rare earth mining and 85% of its processing. The vital components for the green revolution are wholly in Beijing’s hands, giving it profound leverage while the world works to shift from fossil fuels to advanced batteries. It can simply turn off the taps whenever it wants, or merely threaten that very supply to ensure compliance with its interests. Chinese dominance means its apps and tools are in the hands of every American, affording Beijing unparalleled access to every citizen. With apps like TikTok, which already has 150 million users in America, China can censor what our citizens see, ensuring that only Party approved messages a viewed by Americans—it is ubiquitous stealth censorship and the direct erosion of our democracy. A dominant China will promote those who agree with it and denigrate those who run afoul of the Party’s platform. A dominant China is one that pushes America out of the Indo-Pacific and bullies its neighbors, and one that retakes Taiwan by force. China now has the world’s largest navy , with 355 ships at sea, and rising. America’s one-time allies will look elsewhere for security and reassurance, pursuing their own defense policies and creating more instability, not less. In this world, America’s military is a paper tiger, hollowed out, and unable to defend our national interests. This is a future we can avoid if we act today and take the challenge seriously. It means the smart and judicious application of power abroad and the reinvigoration of our democratic republic at home. It means jettisoning the sugar-high politics of confrontation and celebrity and rising above our petty politics. It means getting our fiscal house in order. In 2022, China held $981 billion of our debt, exposing us to unacceptable levels of risk. We cannot afford to spend as recklessly as we do on outdated and inefficient programs that cost more each year and deliver less to our citizens. Reducing our borrowing from China and strengthening our economy at home will create greater stability in both foreign and domestic markets, giving greater confidence in the dollar and enhancing its competitiveness. This means modernizing government, which will lead to smaller, better, and more efficient government. This means ending China’s campaign of industrial espionage of the next generation of technology. The scale of this campaign is staggering: right now, the FBI opens a counterespionage case every 10 hours. It means putting a stop to the Chinese Communist Party’s unfettered access to our country’s best and brightest education and research institutions. It means outcompeting China. This means re-engaging with our allies and partners in international forums. It means mobilizing American business. It means unleashing American innovation, not constraining it for narrow social agendas. It means securing deals with our allies and partners based on the rule of law. In our own hemisphere, China’s reach has rapidly expanded —over 20 countries participate in Beijing’s One Belt, One Road development initiative, and over 15% of Latin America’s exports go to China, up from 1% at the turn of the century. We need to get back out onto the playing field and make American businesses more competitive. An America in charge of its own destiny is one that limits the unfettered access to and manipulation of our democracy. It means taking a much closer look at investments, apps, and technology from China and being unafraid to use the powers of government protect the American people. We must win in this contest against China, but more importantly we can if we act now. Learn more about Mike Rogers and his plan to Get America Back on Track at RogersForSenate.com . Nity Zinser
