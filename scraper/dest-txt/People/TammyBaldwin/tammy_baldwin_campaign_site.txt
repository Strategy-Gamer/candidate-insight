Tammy's Record of
Working for Wisconsin
Tammy Baldwin was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She was raised by her grandfather, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin, and her Nana, a talented seamstress and head costume designer in the UW Theater Department.
When Tammy was nine years old, she came down with a serious illness similar to spinal meningitis. She spent three months in the hospital. But even after she got better, insurance companies refused to cover her because of her “pre-existing condition” label.
Tammy took these lessons to heart and championed important reforms in the Affordable Care Act. Her push to allow kids to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they are 26 years old has helped cover millions of young Americans. Her leadership in protecting people with illnesses has made sure no one is denied care because of a pre-existing condition.
Tammy was raised by her grandparents because her mother struggled with mental illness, chronic pain, and drug abuse. Tammy had to grow-up fast as her mother struggled with addiction to prescription drugs her entire life. So when the opioid epidemic spread across Wisconsin, devastating countless families and entire communities, Tammy worked to make sure Washington finally stepped up and supported local prevention, treatment and recovery efforts in Wisconsin.
As her Nana grew older, Tammy served as her primary caregiver, a challenging but deeply rewarding experience. She saw firsthand the importance of strengthening and protecting Wisconsinites’ earned benefits of Medicare and Social Security. And as a Senator, Tammy worked across party lines to pass bipartisan legislation into law to support family caregivers across America.
Tammy attended public schools, graduating from Madison West High School and went on to Smith College to double-major in government and mathematics. After graduation, she worked on pay equity issues in the Wisconsin governor’s office before beginning her studies at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
During her second semester of law school, Tammy was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors where she served four terms. During her tenure, she made the most of her position chairing the Dane County Task Force on AIDS at the outset of the epidemic. Then, after serving on the Madison Common Council to fill an aldermanic vacancy, Tammy was elected to Wisconsin’s 78th District in the Wisconsin State Assembly.
Following encouragement from friends, family and neighbors, Tammy decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. It wasn’t an easy race. Many powerful people said it wasn’t Tammy’s turn. They told her voters weren’t ready. But Tammy pushed forward — and in 1998, with a scrappy grassroots campaign, she was elected to Congress.
Tammy became Wisconsin’s first female member of Congress and America’s first openly-gay non-incumbent elected to Congress. Tammy got to work, and in addition to leading the health care reforms that allow Wisconsinites to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26 and protect people with pre-existing conditions, she distinguished herself as a fierce defender of working families in Wisconsin.
She led efforts against the unfair trade deals that are responsible for shipping American jobs overseas and holding back wage growth for Wisconsinites. Tammy was one of only a handful of votes against repealing the Glass Steagall Act, which separated risky investment banking from traditional banking. That repeal has repeatedly been pointed out as a driving force behind the 2008 financial crisis.
In the House, Tammy worked across party lines to build consensus around bipartisan legislation to help Wisconsinites. Her bill to help our blinded veterans, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act, passed the House and Senate with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats alike. And she worked hard to make sure her women’s health legislation to expand access to breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings was signed into law by a Republican White House.
In 2012, Tammy Baldwin ran for Senate and Wisconsin made history again. Tammy became the first woman Wisconsin sent to the Senate and the first openly LGBTQ+ Senator in history.
Tammy is building a stronger Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy by championing Buy American rules, confronting unfair trade deals, and helping create good-paying Wisconsin jobs. She is working across party lines to make sure our veterans are supported with the health care, jobs, and community support that they have earned and deserve. When some in Washington pushed partisan repeal efforts that would have ripped health care away from millions of Americans, Tammy led the fight to protect our health care. And recently, Tammy ushered through the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting the freedoms and rights of millions of Americans in same-sex and interracial marriage.
Special interests want Washington to keep working for them, not Wisconsin. As a Senator, Tammy has stood up to the powerful and wealthy who want to keep the system rigged in their favor by holding Wall Street accountable and taking on big pharmaceutical corporations that jack-up the prices of prescription drugs.
So, it’s no surprise that corporate interests, billionaire mega-donors, and shady Super PACs have always made beating Tammy a top priority and have flooded Wisconsin with millions in outside spending against her. But no matter how much they throw against her, Tammy will keep fighting as hard as ever for our families.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Committee and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.
No Representative Actions. You and the Committee agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site is personal to you and the Committee and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as, and you hereby waive the right to bring, a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or the Committee seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address, you and the Committee waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the Committee you agree to first contact the Committee and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“ Notice ”) to the Committee by email at info@tammybaldwin.com. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and the Committee cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Washington, DC unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this Section 13, a “ consumer ” means a person using the Site for personal, family or household purposes. You and the Committee agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“ JAMS Rules ”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
You and the Committee agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “ FAA ”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Committee, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
You and the Committee agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and the Committee will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Committee, the Committee will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Committee agree that the courts of the state of Wisconsin and of the United States sitting in the state of Wisconsin have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the Committee will not have the right to assert the claim.
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 13 by emailing us at info@tammybaldwin.com.

Letter to the Editor Guide
Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin recently joined Kamala Harris at a campaign rally, signaling the excitement among Democrats in the state. Baldwin, a two-term Democrat, is facing a competitive Senate race in a battleground state that Biden narrowly won in 2020. Despite being in a less vulnerable position compared to some Democratic colleagues in other states, Baldwin acknowledges the challenges of winning over voters in today's polarized political climate.
Baldwin's campaign strategy includes reaching out to both the party base and undecided voters. She has been polling better than Biden in the state but faces a formidable opponent in Eric Hovde, a wealthy bank CEO. Hovde, who has self-funded his campaign with millions of dollars, is trying to nationalize the race and tie Baldwin to the current administration.
While Baldwin maintains a lead in recent polls, the race remains competitive. Hovde's efforts to consolidate the GOP base and appeal to undecided voters could impact the outcome. Baldwin's supporters are enthusiastic, and local Democratic parties are experiencing unprecedented levels of engagement and donations.
The presence of Kamala Harris at the rally has injected further enthusiasm into the race, with supporters expressing optimism about the impact of Harris's candidacy on down-ballot Democrats. The upcoming election in Wisconsin's Senate race is poised to be closely watched as both candidates vie for voter support in a state crucial to the balance of power in the Senate.

Tammy Baldwin was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She was raised by her grandfather, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin, and her Nana, a talented seamstress and head costume designer in the UW Theater Department.
When Tammy was nine years old, she came down with a serious illness similar to spinal meningitis. She spent three months in the hospital. But even after she got better, insurance companies refused to cover her because of her “pre-existing condition” label.
Tammy took these lessons to heart and championed important reforms in the Affordable Care Act. Her push to allow kids to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they are 26 years old has helped cover millions of young Americans. Her leadership in protecting people with illnesses has made sure no one is denied care because of a pre-existing condition.
Tammy was raised by her grandparents because her mother struggled with mental illness, chronic pain, and drug abuse. Tammy had to grow-up fast as her mother struggled with addiction to prescription drugs her entire life. So when the opioid epidemic spread across Wisconsin, devastating countless families and entire communities, Tammy worked to make sure Washington finally stepped up and supported local prevention, treatment and recovery efforts in Wisconsin.
As her Nana grew older, Tammy served as her primary caregiver, a challenging but deeply rewarding experience. She saw firsthand the importance of strengthening and protecting Wisconsinites’ earned benefits of Medicare and Social Security. And as a Senator, Tammy worked across party lines to pass bipartisan legislation into law to support family caregivers across America.
Tammy attended public schools, graduating from Madison West High School and went on to Smith College to double-major in government and mathematics. After graduation, she worked on pay equity issues in the Wisconsin governor’s office before beginning her studies at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
During her second semester of law school, Tammy was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors where she served four terms. During her tenure, she made the most of her position chairing the Dane County Task Force on AIDS at the outset of the epidemic. Then, after serving on the Madison Common Council to fill an aldermanic vacancy, Tammy was elected to Wisconsin’s 78th District in the Wisconsin State Assembly.
Following encouragement from friends, family and neighbors, Tammy decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. It wasn’t an easy race. Many powerful people said it wasn’t Tammy’s turn. They told her voters weren’t ready. But Tammy pushed forward — and in 1998, with a scrappy grassroots campaign, she was elected to Congress.
Tammy became Wisconsin’s first female member of Congress and America’s first openly-gay non-incumbent elected to Congress. Tammy got to work, and in addition to leading the health care reforms that allow Wisconsinites to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26 and protect people with pre-existing conditions, she distinguished herself as a fierce defender of working families in Wisconsin.
She led efforts against the unfair trade deals that are responsible for shipping American jobs overseas and holding back wage growth for Wisconsinites. Tammy was one of only a handful of votes against repealing the Glass Steagall Act, which separated risky investment banking from traditional banking. That repeal has repeatedly been pointed out as a driving force behind the 2008 financial crisis.
In the House, Tammy worked across party lines to build consensus around bipartisan legislation to help Wisconsinites. Her bill to help our blinded veterans, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act, passed the House and Senate with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats alike. And she worked hard to make sure her women’s health legislation to expand access to breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings was signed into law by a Republican White House.
In 2012, Tammy Baldwin ran for Senate and Wisconsin made history again. Tammy became the first woman Wisconsin sent to the Senate and the first openly LGBTQ+ Senator in history.
Tammy is building a stronger Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy by championing Buy American rules, confronting unfair trade deals, and helping create good-paying Wisconsin jobs. She is working across party lines to make sure our veterans are supported with the health care, jobs, and community support that they have earned and deserve. When some in Washington pushed partisan repeal efforts that would have ripped health care away from millions of Americans, Tammy led the fight to protect our health care. And recently, Tammy ushered through the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting the freedoms and rights of millions of Americans in same-sex and interracial marriage.
Special interests want Washington to keep working for them, not Wisconsin. As a Senator, Tammy has stood up to the powerful and wealthy who want to keep the system rigged in their favor by holding Wall Street accountable and taking on big pharmaceutical corporations that jack-up the prices of prescription drugs.
So, it’s no surprise that corporate interests, billionaire mega-donors, and shady Super PACs have always made beating Tammy a top priority and have flooded Wisconsin with millions in outside spending against her. But no matter how much they throw against her, Tammy will keep fighting as hard as ever for our families.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is interviewed by Cap Times politics reporter Erin McGroarty at the the headquarters for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin in Madison on June 25, 2024.
Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she can narrow her policy priorities to four W’s: women, wellness, work and water.
The two-term senator, 62, has held some form of public office since 1986 when she was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, after which she served three terms in the Wisconsin Assembly and 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012.
The Democratic senator seeks a third term in office and faces Republican businessman Eric Hovde on November’s general election ballot. Recent polls show Baldwin with a snug lead over Hovde across the state, and the long-time politician says her experience in office sets her apart from her opponent.
Her focus on women revolves around reproductive care and abortion access.
“We have to restore these rights and freedoms,” Baldwin told the Cap Times.
Baldwin was the lead author of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would have codified the federal protections for abortion access originally set out in Roe v. Wade, which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned in 2022.
With regard to “wellness,” Baldwin said she aims to focus legislation on mental health, substance use disorder and expanded access to affordable health care.
“The health care system is so broken,” she said.
Baldwin pointed to a recent victory she and other members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee claimed after investigating the price gouging practices of top manufacturers of inhalers — three of the four companies later agreed to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs by more than $100 per inhaler.
The senator said she has also prioritized securing funding for hospitals in rural Wisconsin and focused efforts on reducing prescription drug prices — moves which have earned her unlikely praise from Republicans in rural Wisconsin.
On another health care issue, Baldwin lamented that medical workers “took a beating” during the COVID-19 pandemic and that their sector of the workforce has yet to bounce back.
Medical workers are not the only ones to be suffering, the senator said.
“You know the old expression that if you work hard and play by the rules, you get ahead. A lot of people struggle with that these days,” Baldwin said. “Between my workforce preparation, apprenticeship and (made) by America rules, I feel like we're making a really big impact and getting good-paying jobs created here in Wisconsin.”
Baldwin said she has prioritized keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States after what she called “decades of poor industrial policy and poor trade policy.”
Those priorities include creating jobs in the construction of electric vehicle charging stations and electrical circuitry that were included in the CHIPS and Sciences Act of 2022.
So how does water play into the senator’s key priorities?
Wisconsin has more inland lakes than Minnesota, “even though they brag about it,” Baldwin joked.
“But we're challenged with lake level issues on the Great Lakes and algae blooms that we didn't used to see before. We have PFAS in drinking water systems, both private wells and public utilities, farm nutrient runoff issues and the lead laterals that still are in many municipal systems,” Baldwin said. “I just think you can't be a Wisconsinite and not be deeply caring about our water.”
This includes an act Baldwin has brought forward to create grants for homeowners to test their individual wells for PFAS contamination. The bill was co-authored with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.
Bipartisan cooperation is an element of her political career that Baldwin prides herself on and a quality she said resonates with a varied voter base across Wisconsin.
Sen. Tammy Baldwin said her top policy priorites if re-elected will remain women, wellness, work and water.
She pointed to a bill she co-authored with Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio that would require online distributors to list where an item was made.
“You’ve got to figure out where you can find common ground if you're going to be a successful senator on behalf of the people you represent,” Baldwin said, while she acknowledged that she and Vance starkly differ on a majority of issues.
Baldwin sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is made up of 12 subcommittees tasked with deciding how individual federal agencies should be funded. The senator’s subcommittee decides funding levels for the departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services.
Each year the subcommittee members receive an allocation of federal money with which they have to craft a budget bill. Last year, Baldwin co-wrote the bill with Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.
“That passed out of committee on a 26-2 vote, in a committee that is pretty much half and half (between Republicans and Democrats),” Baldwin said. “That's never going to make a headline. But the idea that we had that level of bipartisan support and commitment in putting that bill together, it shows my ability to do work across the party aisle.”
A key criticism of Baldwin is that she has spent almost her entire career in politics. But the senator said her time in public office is a strength.
“There's no way to replace the years that I've had a chance to understand deeply various industries in Wisconsin,” Baldwin said. “It's given me the opportunity to have Wisconsinites offer their insights on things that are important.”
Baldwin’s campaign against Hovde has been colored by political hits from both sides, and in a world where politics often focuses on the negative, the Cap Times asked both Hovde and Baldwin to name something they think “is going right in this country.”
“This is a tough one to figure out how to word, but I think almost through some of the things that have gone wrong, we are understanding a new responsibility to protect our democracy,” Baldwin said.
Baldwin faced no opposition in Tuesday’s primary election and will meet Hovde head-to-head on November’s general election ballot to determine who will represent Wisconsin at-large alongside Republican Sen. Ron Johnson.

Tammy Baldwin said she can narrow her policy priorities to four W’s: women, wellness, work and water. The two-term senator, 62, has held some form of public office since 1986 when she was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, after which she served three terms in the Wisconsin Assembly and 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012. The Democratic senator seeks a third term in office and faces Republican businessman Eric Hovde on November’s general election ballot. Recent polls show Baldwin with a snug lead over Hovde across the state, and the long-time politician says her experience in office sets her apart from her opponent. Her focus on women revolves around reproductive care and abortion access. “We have to restore these rights and freedoms,” Baldwin told the Cap Times. Baldwin was the lead author of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would have codified the federal protections for abortion access originally set out in Roe v. Wade, which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned in 2022. With regard to “wellness,” Baldwin said she aims to focus legislation on mental health, substance use disorder and expanded access to affordable health care. “The health care system is so broken,” she said. Baldwin pointed to a recent victory she and other members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee claimed after investigating the price gouging practices of top manufacturers of inhalers — three of the four companies later agreed to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs by more than $100 per inhaler. The senator said she has also prioritized securing funding for hospitals in rural Wisconsin and focused efforts on reducing prescription drug prices — moves which have earned her unlikely praise from Republicans in rural Wisconsin. On another health care issue, Baldwin lamented that medical workers “took a beating” during the COVID-19 pandemic and that their sector of the workforce has yet to bounce back. Medical workers are not the only ones to be suffering, the senator said. “You know the old expression that if you work hard and play by the rules, you get ahead. A lot of people struggle with that these days,” Baldwin said. “Between my workforce preparation, apprenticeship and (made) by America rules, I feel like we're making a really big impact and getting good-paying jobs created here in Wisconsin.” Baldwin said she has prioritized keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States after what she called “decades of poor industrial policy and poor trade policy.” Those priorities include creating jobs in the construction of electric vehicle charging stations and electrical circuitry that were included in the CHIPS and Sciences Act of 2022. So how does water play into the senator’s key priorities? Wisconsin has more inland lakes than Minnesota, “even though they brag about it,” Baldwin joked. “But we're challenged with lake level issues on the Great Lakes and algae blooms that we didn't used to see before. We have PFAS in drinking water systems, both private wells and public utilities, farm nutrient runoff issues and the lead laterals that still are in many municipal systems,” Baldwin said. “I just think you can't be a Wisconsinite and not be deeply caring about our water.” This includes an act Baldwin has brought forward to create grants for homeowners to test their individual wells for PFAS contamination. The bill was co-authored with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Senator boasts of bipartisanship Bipartisan cooperation is an element of her political career that Baldwin prides herself on and a quality she said resonates with a varied voter base across Wisconsin. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said her top policy priorites if re-elected will remain women, wellness, work and water. RUTHIE HAUGE She pointed to a bill she co-authored with Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio that would require online distributors to list where an item was made. “You’ve got to figure out where you can find common ground if you're going to be a successful senator on behalf of the people you represent,” Baldwin said, while she acknowledged that she and Vance starkly differ on a majority of issues. Baldwin sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is made up of 12 subcommittees tasked with deciding how individual federal agencies should be funded. The senator’s subcommittee decides funding levels for the departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services. Each year the subcommittee members receive an allocation of federal money with which they have to craft a budget bill. Last year, Baldwin co-wrote the bill with Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. “That passed out of committee on a 26-2 vote, in a committee that is pretty much half and half (between Republicans and Democrats),” Baldwin said. “That's never going to make a headline.

Wisconsin Ag Connection Home > News
By Blake Jackson
U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, has secured significant support for Wisconsin farmers and rural communities through bipartisan agriculture funding legislation recently passed unanimously by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The legislation includes several key initiatives aimed at bolstering Wisconsin's agricultural sector and supporting rural development.
Senator Baldwin's efforts in the Fiscal Year 2025 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill focus on enhancing resources for dairy businesses, improving farming efficiencies, addressing farmers' mental health, and safeguarding American farmland from foreign investment. The bill now advances to the full Senate for consideration.
“Wisconsin’s farmers and ranchers work hard every day to put our state on the map with world-class products and move our Made in Wisconsin economy forward. I’m proud to have their backs, creating and championing programs that help boost businesses’ bottom lines and keep Wisconsin families safe and healthy,” said Senator Baldwin.
Rebekah Sweeney, Senior Director of Programs and Policy at the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, praised Senator Baldwin's advocacy: “Senator Baldwin again today demonstrated her steadfast commitment to dairy farmers and processors and her effectiveness as a lawmaker, securing support for education, research, and direct-to-business grants via the Dairy Business Innovation Initiative.”
Senator Baldwin also championed the Innovative Feed Enhancement and Economic Development (FEED) Act, which facilitates FDA approval for new feed additives to enhance efficiency in meat and dairy production.
This legislation aims to help American farmers compete globally while reducing byproducts.
Despite fiscal constraints, Senator Baldwin maintained funding for the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) at $10 million. FRSAN provides crucial mental health resources for farmers, connecting them with stress assistance programs and suicide prevention training.
Furthermore, Senator Baldwin advocated for transparency in foreign ownership of American farmland through provisions like those in the Farmland Security Act.
The bill directs USDA to improve reporting on foreign ownership and enforce penalties for non-compliance.
Senator Baldwin's commitment also extends to environmental conservation, as evidenced by her support for the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (GLCI), securing $20 million to help farmers implement managed grazing practices that contribute to carbon sequestration.

The total liability of the Committee and the Committee Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Sites, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to $5.
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Committee and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.
No Representative Actions. You and the Committee agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site is personal to you and the Committee and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as, and you hereby waive the right to bring, a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or the Committee seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address, you and the Committee waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the Committee you agree to first contact the Committee and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“ Notice ”) to the Committee by email at info@tammybaldwin.com. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and the Committee cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Washington, DC unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this Section 13, a “ consumer ” means a person using the Site for personal, family or household purposes. You and the Committee agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“ JAMS Rules ”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
You and the Committee agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “ FAA ”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Committee, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
You and the Committee agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and the Committee will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Committee, the Committee will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Committee agree that the courts of the state of Wisconsin and of the United States sitting in the state of Wisconsin have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the Committee will not have the right to assert the claim.
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 13 by emailing us at info@tammybaldwin.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 14.
If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable.
With respect to any text programs offered by the Committee, the Committee’s platform provider is a third-party beneficiary of the foregoing arbitration, class action, and jury waiver provisions.
Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Site will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of Wisconsin, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Wisconsin or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties will be resolved in the courts of Wisconsin and the United States, respectively, sitting in Wisconsin.
We reserve the right to modify our Site or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Site at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Site at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Site.
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
The failure of the Committee to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
