8/ So the EU’s move today should be a reminder to the U.S.: if we allow Chinese vehicles in, or fail to innovate and compete in this global market, we too are at risk of Chinese vehicles dominating in the decades to come.

2024-10-30T17:05:20.000Z
7/ And it’s certainly why we can't surrender to China in the fight to build next-generation vehicles. Federal investments like the grant for GM’s Lansing Grand River plant are part of how we fight back against China’s strategy &amp; preserve jobs.

2024-10-30T17:05:20.000Z
6/ It’s also why I led a group of colleagues asking Mexico’s newly elected president to take action against the national security threat to both our countries if China pushes further into the North American market.

2024-10-30T17:05:19.000Z
5/ That’s why I’ve introduced legislation to ensure a national security review of these vehicles before they can be sold in the United States. This builds on my provision in the NDAA to keep Chinese connected vehicles off our military bases.

2024-10-30T17:05:19.000Z
4/ To be clear, this isn’t just about economic security. Chinese vehicles – including those from companies like BYD – have sophisticated cameras, radar, &amp; geolocation allowing them to gather sensitive data on Americans &amp; our critical infrastructure.

3/ In Europe, Chinese-made EVs have increased their market share nearly seven-fold in just three years. And in Mexico, China is seeking to build factories that could allow it entry into the U.S. market.

2024-10-30T17:05:18.000Z
2/ China clearly has a plan when it comes to cars: flood global markets with heavily subsidized EVs, under-sell local car makers with rock-bottom prices, and dominate markets for future generations of cars and trucks.

2024-10-30T17:05:18.000Z
1/ Today the EU officially began imposing tariffs as high as 45% on Chinese EVs – but there’s a real cautionary tale about how they got here for us in the U.S. 🧵

One of the duties of a Member of Congress is to flag and alert threats that might be around the corner. And as a national security professional who knows that the future of warfare is data and who controls it, I’ll continue working to address the threat of connected vehicles.

2024-10-08T19:34:03.000Z
Then last week, @sensherrodbrown and I wrote a letter – joined by nearly two dozen of our colleagues – to Mexico’s President urging her to address the national security threat posed by these advanced vehicles. https://t.co/D2uWwwhuPa

In an op-ed in the Detroit News, I applauded the restrictions and Secretary Raimondo for taking action, while calling upon Congress to stop talking and pass my legislation to make sure the cars on our roads aren’t a threat to national security. https://t.co/tsbZsMO2PY

In June, I introduced legislation to do just that. The Connected Vehicle National Security Review Act would create a formal national security review for connected vehicles and components built by companies from China or other adversaries. https://t.co/hq2zLNRwdN

2024-10-08T19:34:00.000Z
This confirmed what I thought, so I spoke in May on the House floor to sound the alarm on this threat and make clear that we must write into law a process to vet these vehicles through a national security lens. https://t.co/8HBP93qQWE

Thank you, @SecRaimondo, for addressing this threat and working with our companies to get this right. Now it’s on a bipartisan group in Congress to pass legislation that would give us stronger tools to protect Americans’ privacy and the security of our critical infrastructure.

2024-09-23T14:11:42.000Z
One bill would strengthen defenses against the national security threat of Chinese vehicles entering our markets, as they have in Europe and Mexico. The second applies more broadly to information and communications technology beyond autos. https://t.co/hq2zLNQYof

Today’s action by @CommerceGov is an important step – but Congress needs to help by making it law, not just the actions of one administration that can be reversed every 4 years. That’s why I’ve introduced 2 bills to strengthen our defenses against threats.https://t.co/NVIJbYJ1o0

2024-09-23T14:11:41.000Z

They were exhausted, worried about their families at home, &amp; uncertain of what would happen to them. They asked me not to forget them, and as someone whose own family left a foreign land in search of a better life, I assured them I'd do everything I could to get them to the U.S.

2024-08-29T15:07:57.000Z
@SpiritAmerica, an incredible non-profit organization, cared for the group in Albania while their U.S. visas were vetted and processed, and in November 2021 I traveled to Albania to meet them in person for the first time – one of the most moving experiences of my career.

2024-08-29T15:07:56.000Z
Through an old friend, @amb_yurikim, we secured temporary safe harbor for the group in Albania – a nation that opened up its arms to welcome those who had nowhere else to go. Foreign Minister @xhacka_olta met them on the tarmac as they began the next chapter of their lives. https://t.co/8rskJS0maT

Their incredible odyssey was made possible through a network of good Samaritans around the globe who contributed to the effort due to a shared obligation to help those who helped us in their time of greatest need.

2024-08-29T15:07:55.000Z
Over the course of ten days, this group navigated an impossibly difficult environment – renting buses, moving through Taliban checkpoints in the dark, and dodging gunfire – finally making it through the gates at the airport and onto a plane that would bring them to safe harbor.

Those waging this campaign are also trying to hide and obscure their efforts now that such measures are politically unpopular. They claim they ”want to leave it to the states,” but constantly sponsor, vote for, support, and quietly cheer the incessant attacks on our rights. 9/10

2024-06-24T14:05:37.000Z
Michigan set the example nationwide in 2022 by voting via a ballot initiative to codify Roe, but even strong state laws are meaningless against federal legislation, federal bans, and decisions made by the Supreme Court. 8/10

When taken together, these votes paint a clear picture of an all-out campaign to chip away at a woman’s right to choose wherever possible with an end-goal of eliminating abortion access nationwide. 6/10

Last July, and AGAIN this year, the GOP added an amendment to the House version of the annual, must-pass defense bill to prohibit a servicewoman serving in a full-ban state like Texas from taking leave to go to another state for an abortion for herself or for her daughter. 3/10

2024-06-24T14:05:34.000Z

It’s been two years since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade – ending *50 years* of a federal right to an abortion. And despite the ruling leaving the issue up to the states, the House GOP has still waged an all-out campaign to claw choice away from women nationwide. 1/10

2024-06-13T15:18:04.000Z
The EU is right to combat unfair Chinese trade policies that make their EVs artificially cheap, just as the US has already done.

It’s critical that we protect and support the next generation of farmers, including small farmers. That’s why, as the only Michigander on the House Agriculture Committee, I am keeping them in mind as my colleagues and I continue to work towards passing a bipartisan Farm Bill. 5/5

2024-06-12T19:23:02.000Z

2024-06-12T19:23:02.000Z
Specialty crops – from cherries, to asparagus, to dry beans – are Michigan’s bread and butter, and the reason we are America’s most agriculturally diverse state with regular access to water, so it’s important that the farmers that grow them are represented in Congress. 3/5

It’s therefore critical that we carefully read any and all legislation, and don’t give an inch to those who wish to turn back the clock on a woman’s right to choose. 5/5

2024-06-05T21:29:18.000Z
So let’s be clear: this is just another part of an all-out campaign to eliminate choice for women nationwide, in whichever way possible. It was never just about reversing Roe, despite what some would like the public to believe. 4/5

2024-06-05T21:29:18.000Z
This bill even prevents the VA from even talking to female veterans about reproductive options. This would mean that our veterans would have less access to reproductive health options than the average American. 3/5

Since the fall of Roe, we've seen a consistent campaign to restrict choice in new and different ways. Just about every time we vote on important legislation in the House, there’s an attempt to use it to limit reproductive care in some form or fashion. 1/5 https://t.co/myRv2LbSBe

I support the President’s actions today to secure the border — it’s a last ditch effort given that House Republicans declared a tough bipartisan border security deal “dead on arrival”. https://t.co/vo1itiCAWJ

We need a package that secures our border, reforms our system so that immigrants can be vetted and approved before they hit our borders, and upholds our values as a nation of immigrants.

2024-06-04T20:08:33.000Z
House Republicans declared the deal "dead on arrival" despite claiming that the border was their #1 concern. There is only one way to actually address this issue: legislators from both parties need to lock themselves in a room and hash out comprehensive, bipartisan legislation.

2024-06-04T20:08:33.000Z
It’s unfortunate that executive action is even necessary. We were poised to finally take a real step forward by passing the bipartisan immigration agreement negotiated in the Senate, and endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council.

When I visited some Detroit urban farmers in March, I knew we needed to connect the farmers at the local level with @USDA and @MichDeptofAg. And there was no better time to do so than in advance of the House Ag Committee markup of the Farm Bill this week. 1/5 https://t.co/r4ithTgQ80

After COVID, we all know that access to the internet is essential. That’s why I joined my colleagues in a letter earlier this month that urges Congressional leadership to keep the ACP funded, and I’ll continue to advocate for its support. 4/4

2024-05-18T14:55:27.000Z
And while it doesn’t grab headlines, the ACP matters to constituents: close to 400 people have contacted my office just in the past week to share the ways this program has helped them. They’re worried that losing it will cause themselves or their families to lose access. 3/4

2024-05-18T14:55:27.000Z
One in seven households in our district relies on it – more than 43,000 constituents, but right now there’s no plan to extend funding, leaving millions of families without access to the internet and expanding the “digital divide” that hurts working families. 2/4

2024-05-18T14:55:27.000Z
🧵Want to know one of the hot topics on my office phone lines? The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps households with the cost of broadband access  and has become a lifeline for Americans. 1/4

The best part of my Friday morning: Speaking with 8th grade students from Fowlerville Middle School on their D.C. trip! They came ready with some serious questions, and I can’t wait to see what amazing things they do. https://t.co/9ZxS1XS8cO

2024-05-17T20:52:56.000Z
Given that, myself and 14 others wrote to POTUS, saying that given the collapse, he needed to act. While any future action will likely be challenged in court, we felt it was important to move ahead in light of Trump calling an all-halt to negotiations. 5/5 https://t.co/WyH4GDXUyv

2024-05-17T20:52:55.000Z
But at the 11th hour, former President Trump intervened and told his GOP leaders to stand down. He didn’t want action on the border, but to instead use the problem in his reelection campaign. After that, negotiations on any real solutions collapsed. 4/5 https://t.co/zgy6u8KH5Z

2024-05-17T20:52:55.000Z
If we want concrete action, we need a bipartisan bill negotiated in good faith. We were on the edge of an important deal back in February, when Sens. Lankford, Murphy, and others lead the drafts of a bipartisan law that would give the President more power to act. 3/5

2024-05-17T20:52:54.000Z
Accordingly, I voted yes on the former and no on the latter. The reality is that none of these three bills will be taken up by the Senate, so they’ll do nothing to address the actual situation at the southern border. 2/5

2024-05-17T20:52:54.000Z
This week, we voted on a number of border security and immigration bills brought by GOP leadership: two bills that, while not the greatest policy, largely repeated existing law, and once again, a non-binding resolution that says a lot and does nothing. 1/5

2024-05-17T16:58:54.000Z
Their bravery on that Arkansas morning paved the way for generations to come and is a pivotal moment in American history, and it is only fitting that they be recognized with the highest honor the President can give. 5/5

2024-05-17T16:58:54.000Z
The Little Rock Nine have previously received the Congressional Gold Medal, but have never been honored by the White House. So, on the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, I’m writing to @POTUS to consider awarding them the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 4/5

2024-05-17T16:58:53.000Z
Members of the group Ernest Green and Carlotta Walls LaNier both went on to attend @michiganstateu, with Green later receiving both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in East Lansing. 3/5

2024-05-17T16:58:53.000Z
The ruling wasn’t tested however until 1957, when nine Black students demonstrated extraordinary courage and successfully enrolled in school in Little Rock, Arkansas. They were the Little Rock Nine, and some might not know that some of them have connections to Lansing. 2/5

2024-05-17T16:58:52.000Z
In 1954, 70 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional – a landmark decision and a key moment in the Civil Rights Movement that paved the way for integration nationwide. 1/5

2024-05-17T13:22:57.000Z
So, make sure to check in on any officers in your life – it’s so important that we all show well-deserved respect and gratitude to the police that work on behalf of us each and every day. 5/5

2024-05-17T13:22:56.000Z
I’ve advocated in Congress for ways to address those challenges, having secured funding in the federal budget for police departments in our district and led legislation to invest in small police departments for training, equipment, and officer support. 4/5
https://t.co/vUX87sGr5A

2024-05-17T13:22:56.000Z
The officers that responded to those tragedies arrived at a scene no one is prepared for – no matter their training – and that heroic work comes with a cost. Officers often confront serious mental health challenges from situations like mass shootings and others. 3/5

2024-05-17T13:22:55.000Z
Through my time representing Mid-Michigan, I’ve had the chance to see that dedication up close, having met with department leaders across our district, participated in a ride along, and worked with police in the wake of the Oxford and MSU shootings. 2/5

2024-05-17T13:22:55.000Z
As we come to the end of National Police Week, it’s an important moment to recognize the dedicated law enforcement officers in our communities and reflect on their deeply important work protecting and supporting communities here in Michigan and across the country. 1/5

These are just some of the things we’ll be discussing next week as we start to mark up the first draft of the Pentagon budget in the House Armed Services Committee. 4/4

2024-05-16T18:05:13.000Z
But that doesn’t mean we can take our feet off the gas – we need to make sure those shipments move quickly, training accelerates, and that Ukraine has the right to defend itself from the Russian artillery hitting them from just over the border. 3/4

2024-05-16T18:05:12.000Z
While it should have arrived months ago, that aid is finally set to deliver critical weapons to the front lines and make a difference on the battlefield, and stop the first authoritarian invasion of a democracy since World War II. 2/4

2024-05-16T18:05:12.000Z
Yesterday, I sat down with my friend @SashaUstinovaUA and other Ukrainian parliamentarians for the first time since the passing of the National Security Supplemental last month, which will provide long-overdue aid the Ukrainians need to repel an ongoing Russian offensive. 1/4 https://t.co/Idfu0HcKA7

The last year has seen far too much partisanship – but it has also demonstrated that when we do our jobs &amp; negotiate in good faith, we can accomplish important things. I’m grateful to the Lugar Center for recognizing lawmakers who put country before party.

As a former CIA officer and Pentagon official, I’ve been sounding the alarm on the threats Chinese vehicles pose to our national and economic security.

2024-05-14T00:13:14.000Z
The future of threats won’t just be traditional tanks and aircraft — it will be data and who controls it. That’s why I’m sounding the alarm on Chinese connected vehicles and am pushing for imports to be vetted through a national security lens. https://t.co/0Qa1Uqigj0

2024-05-10T20:28:53.000Z
It is well past time for both parties to come together and agree on reasonable, bipartisan immigration reforms, but in light of the paralysis on the Hill, it’s time for the administration to take action as a last resort. https://t.co/2ftxXnKhaW

I’m grateful that so far it appears no lives were lost — and for all the first responders who jumped into action last night. 7/7

2024-05-08T15:28:13.000Z
I’ve continued to stay in touch with folks affected by last August’s tornado in #MI07, and perhaps the biggest lesson is that the road to recovery is long, but there is help available and federal, state &amp; local officials are mobilizing to respond. 6/7

2024-05-08T15:28:13.000Z
If your home or business is damaged, you’ll want to document it with photos &amp; report it to your county’s emergency management team, which can show the damage in assistance applications. Below is a self-reporting link officials will use to collect data: 5/7 https://t.co/99B6Edrxgn

2024-05-08T15:28:12.000Z
It’s also vital that emergency crews can clear downed lines &amp; debris, so officials have asked people to avoid traveling to the areas that were hit hard — which was an issue last August when people wanted to survey damage around I-96, but ultimately hindered clean up efforts. 4/7

2024-05-08T15:28:12.000Z
Importantly, call 211 if you need assistance after last night’s storms. @GovWhitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch &amp; Cass counties, meaning the state is coordinating with county &amp; local officials on recovery efforts. 3/7 https://t.co/QFgEcaLFvq

2024-05-08T15:28:11.000Z
And while the recovery continues in #MI07, I know people in &amp; around Portage are asking what's next after last night's tornadoes. Here are some tips based on our experience after the August storms. 🧵2/7

Today is the last day for people hit by last August's storms to file for assistance, which covers Eaton, Ingham, Livingston, &amp; Oakland counties. 1/7

2024-05-07T20:47:42.000Z
FINAL REMINDER: The deadline for those affected by last August’s storms to apply for federal resources is TOMORROW, May 8. 

The declaration covers residents in Eaton, Ingham, Livingston, and Oakland counties in #MI07. ⬇️ https://t.co/2BdnilIvLR

2024-05-06T16:56:57.000Z
The future of threats won’t just be your traditional tanks and aircraft, but rather data and who controls it – which is why I’m concerned about a potential flood of Chinese connected vehicles entering the U.S. market. https://t.co/Qil8V3sKHy

2024-05-04T23:39:12.000Z
Universities would be doing themselves a favor by being crystal clear about threatening and intimidating speech, and enforcing it as soon as incidents like this crop up. 5/5

2024-05-04T23:39:12.000Z
Any group shouting “guillotine, guillotine” on campus fits into that category. It creates a climate of fear for Jewish students and shouldn’t be tolerated. 4/5

2024-05-04T23:39:12.000Z
If you are calling for violence against an individual or group, calling for armed resistance against an individual or group, glorifying terrorists who use violence, depicting weapons in literature, &amp; so on, university leaders have a responsibility to hold people accountable. 3/5

2024-05-04T23:39:12.000Z
Campus leaders have rules on the books that make clear that the campus should be safe from intimidation for all students. 2/5

2024-05-04T23:39:11.000Z
🧵What we saw at GW today is what I mean when I say colleges need to draw a line between peaceful protest and words and actions that make our campuses unsafe. Calling for executions goes way over that line. 1/5 https://t.co/YqbQG3j1MK
