It is not safe to be pregnant in a state without abortion access. Doctors fear prosecution and imprisonment for providing lifesaving care. This is untenable.

This year something powerful has happened. So many non politicians, non political people have jumped in - either as candidates or as party chairs and operatives - to change this. And it is truly glorious to be involved with, intimately.

2024-07-29T19:21:47.000Z
Basically for a decade the ballots have not been competitive. It has not been a two party system but a one party system in most of these districts.

Southern Baptists vote to condemn IVF usage. This is an utterly devastating outcome. For all the families that have to grapple with the loss of IVF support in their church, I am truly sorry. We can stop this from becoming official government policy, if we act in November.

There are ways to safely enjoy gun ownership, and I will fight for laws to make our kids and communities safer. 

#MaryamForCongress #ThisIsOurFight #gunsafety #firearmsafety #momsdemand

2024-05-29T14:17:05.000Z
When we required permits and training, gun owners had to learn about safe storage and handling of a gun. It worked to decrease injuries. If we required everyone to safely store their weapons, these accidental shootings would disappear.

2024-05-29T14:17:04.000Z
If this number was stagnant we could assume it had nothing to do with our gun safety laws. But the fact that these accidental shootings are increasing in our state, as we chip away at all of our gun safety protections, tells us this is completely PREVENTABLE.

2024-05-29T14:17:04.000Z
2023 saw the highest number of accidental shootings of children, and it will likely come to no surprise but Tennessee is #3 in the country for accidental shootings. 
Roughly once every day in the United States, a child unintentionally shoots themself or someone else.

2024-05-22T14:55:16.000Z
Also, women - the ones who are directly impacted by so many of the dangerous laws in Tennessee - feel a different kind of way than men (20 points gap between their political beliefs especially on healthcare). This has been shown to me every where that I've gone throughout #TN5,

2024-05-22T14:55:15.000Z
And as we've known, 76% of Tennesseans - majority gun owners - want to make sure that their kids are safe from #gunviolence, especially from those that are ready to harm themselves or others. Responsible gun ownership remains a key priority.

2024-05-22T14:55:15.000Z
But Tennesseans get it. We know that #abortion access is healthcare, we know that women need it to be safe, and we know that IVF access should be protected. We need politicians to stop interfering in our medical care, our lives, and our freedoms.

Since Ogles only managed to get 3 bills passed in this Congress this year, none of which do anything to help Tennesseans, maybe he could focus on how to do that instead of criminal court cases.

If you think banning #abortion doesn‚Äôt affect you because you don‚Äôt need one, you‚Äôd be mistaken. Healthcare bans affect all of us.

The violence that Representative Ogles wishes upon young Americans is absolutely horrific. Not only has he promoted gun violence - the #1 killer of TN kids - he‚Äôs outwardly proposing to send our college students to a war zone. This has got to stop. Gov representatives are meant

Definitely not. I am not interested in growth that continues to drive a wedge between the haves and have nots. I am interested in policies that make it possible to be a thriving middle class.

Since I moved back to Nashville in 2018, median home prices have gone up almost $100k. That is totally unsustainable for middle class families. Growth is a great thing, but it must lift everyone up with it. There are changes that can be done at the federal level to help ensure

While Tennesseans are trying to deal with the price of gas, groceries and rent, while women are wondering if they can actual become pregnant safely in this state, while kids ask their parents if their school is a safe one, Ogles wants to make sure our washing machines waste more

Ogles has a long list of totally ridiculous bills like the ‚ÄúHot Showers Act‚Äù or ‚ÄúLiberty in Laundry‚Äù. I wish it were funny but it‚Äôs not because we actually need government to be working for us, not making a joke about us right now.
