Nevadans across the board have agreed for decades that reopening Yucca Mountain would be an environmental disaster and unwanted hazard for our state.

But my extremist opponent Sam Brown? He thinks making Nevada the nation‚Äôs nuclear dumping ground is an ‚Äúincredible opportunity.‚Äù https://t.co/kMrH8kx5pe

My motto is: agree where you can, and fight where you must. I‚Äôll work with anyone on the issues that matter to Nevadans because hardworking families are counting on us to deliver results for them. https://t.co/fma4gfJ1c8

This election is about a choice. Nevada voters are going to choose a senator with a record of working across the aisle to get things done over a MAGA extremist who will sell us out to his billionaire donors if he‚Äôs given the chance.

Hardworking Nevada families are being squeezed by rising costs, and I‚Äôm fighting back by standing up to corporate special interests who are making record profits at our expense.

2024-10-23T22:55:57.000Z
@CortezMasto @KamalaHarris You‚Äôre exactly right, Catherine. Nevada‚Äôs elections are the closest in the country and we need every Nevadan to vote between now and November 5th so we can defend my Senate seat and keep making progress for our state.

2024-10-23T22:31:39.000Z
Nevadans deserve a Senator with a proven record of bipartisan problem-solving for our state ‚Äì not another MAGA politician whose only priority is pleasing Trump.

The cost of buying a home or affording rent has gotten out of control. I‚Äôm standing up to corporate investors who buy up housing and jack up prices because hardworking Nevadans deserve some breathing room.

In tonight‚Äôs #NVSen debate, Nevadans were presented with a clear contrast.

I‚Äôm fighting for Nevada families ‚Äì and delivering real results.

Sam Brown will always put MAGA over Nevada, and voters will reject his extreme agenda at the ballot box.

2024-10-18T03:07:40.000Z

Nevadans don‚Äôt want nuclear waste in their backyard, but Sam Brown called Yucca Mountain an ‚Äúincredible opportunity‚Äù for our state. 

He is out of step with Nevada.

2024-10-18T02:35:11.000Z
Sam Brown opposed the strongest border security legislation in decades because Donald Trump told him to. He would rather use immigration as a political football than work on solutions.

2024-10-18T02:21:59.000Z
As a Jewish woman and former synagogue president, supporting Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself is personal for me.

The cost of buying a house or affording rent has gotten out of control. I‚Äôm taking action by standing up to corporate housing investors who jack up prices, working to cut taxes for first-time homebuyers, and pushing to open up federal land to build more affordable housing.

2024-10-18T02:13:26.000Z
I grew up in a working-class family and worked multiple jobs, where I relied on tips to make ends meet.

2024-10-18T02:06:33.000Z

My extreme opponent Sam Brown spread dangerous conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and pushed to overturn the results here in Nevada.

My opponent will do or say anything to get elected, including trying to hide his far-right agenda from Nevada voters.

But we know the facts about his MAGA loyalty and anti-abortion record ‚Äì and Nevadans will reject that extremism in November.

Social Security and Medicare allow our seniors to retire with dignity and peace of mind.

2024-08-17T18:11:18.000Z
‚ÄúA moral atrocity.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what the anti-abortion group where my extreme opponent Sam Brown served as local president said about abortion.

He is out of touch and too extreme for Nevada.

2024-08-16T21:31:05.000Z

We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors and finally empowered Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices ‚Äì a historic investment that is bringing down costs for hardworking families.

My MAGA opponent called it ‚Äúa big loss for the American people.‚Äù

2024-08-16T16:33:53.000Z
Thanks to the historic law that I proudly helped pass two years ago, we‚Äôre lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, investing in clean energy and manufacturing, and creating thousands of good-paying jobs right here in Nevada.

I‚Äôll always fight to protect the hard-earned benefits that Nevadans rely on for their retirement.

2024-08-14T16:42:23.000Z

‚ÄúAn incredible opportunity.‚Äù

Kyleigh is one of so many women who have been denied life-saving reproductive care since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Her story is devastating and we can‚Äôt let this keep happening.

2024-08-09T23:10:00.000Z
My far-right opponent Sam Brown advocated for overturning Roe v. Wade ‚Äì a Supreme Court decision that was devastating to women's reproductive freedom.

My opponent has a long anti-abortion history:

Nevada is increasingly vulnerable to wildfires, and our homeowners are now facing sky-rocketing premiums and insufficient coverage. I‚Äôm calling for these rising costs to be addressed, because I won‚Äôt let Nevada families be left behind by insurers.

Our future depends on the Senate, and the Senate depends on what happens in battleground Nevada.

I‚Äôll always fight to protect Nevadans' reproductive freedoms and hard-earned benefits like Social Security and Medicare in the Senate. My extreme opponent won‚Äôt.

My opponent Sam Brown will do anything to get elected ‚Äì including hiding his extreme MAGA agenda.

From saying his anti-abortion views are ‚Äúnon-negotiable‚Äù to praising a plan to phase out Social Security &amp; Medicare, Brown is out of step with Nevadans.

The majority of Nevadans oppose storing the nation‚Äôs nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain because the science shows it‚Äôs not safe.

I‚Äôm leading the fight to come up with alternate uses for the site that would create good-paying jobs while protecting our state.

It‚Äôs been 64 years since the FDA approved the birth control pill, but anti-abortion extremists are still trying to limit women‚Äôs access to basic health care like contraception.

I will ALWAYS stand up for a woman‚Äôs right to make her own family planning decisions.

2024-05-08T23:30:46.000Z
A woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her own health care should never be up for debate. Period.

2024-05-08T21:35:37.000Z
No one should ever have to worry about how they‚Äôre going to afford their life-saving medications.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working across the aisle to lower prescription drug costs for older Nevadans.
