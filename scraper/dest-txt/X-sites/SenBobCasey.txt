2024-10-29T16:07:28.000Z
I’ve fought to restore rail service between Scranton and New York for my whole career in the Senate. With funding from the infrastructure law, we’re finally making real progress. Today I joined @RepCartwright to announce funding that will begin construction on the line. https://t.co/Io9GUznaw6

Six years ago, 11 people were killed in a horrific and hateful act of antisemitism in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. Today we remember those worshipers and recommit to rooting out the evil of antisemitism wherever it emerges. https://t.co/fMzOHd80fm

The Iranian regime seeks to annihilate Israel, including funding and emboldening the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. The United States stands with Israel in its right to defend itself. https://t.co/4kX35T4gim

Pennsylvania workers are the backbone of our Nation’s economy. I will always fight to support our workers, create good union jobs, and bring investments to the Commonwealth that help Pennsylvanians support their families. https://t.co/aW1wVN9XwG

I'm proud to announce that small business owners and farmers across Pennsylvania will benefit from @USDA's REAP program.
$24.1M toward creating jobs, lowering energy, and expanding access to clean energy. https://t.co/nQ09ys72sP

2024-10-24T14:51:00.000Z
From putting food on the table, to powering our homes and businesses, Pennsylvania energy is a life-sustaining industry. I’m fighting to expand energy investments in the Commonwealth to ensure Pennsylvania’s proud energy sector can continue to be a leader for the future. https://t.co/7SQoo78KFV

2024-10-23T22:54:36.000Z
Today’s repeated attacks on Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia are an appalling act of antisemitism. The perpetrators must be found and held accountable. I have contacted Rabbi Yosef to offer my support to Mikveh Israel and Philadelphia’s entire Jewish community.

2024-10-23T18:56:50.000Z
Investments in our airports are critical to make them more efficient, improve the passenger experience, and help keep passengers and workers safe.

Yahya Sinwar was the architect of unspeakable violence and terror, including the barbaric October 7th attacks where more than 1,200 Israelis were brutally murdered. His death is a measure of justice for the terror he has wrought. 

This is a great victory for Israel.

2024-10-16T19:47:24.000Z
When given a fair shot, Pennsylvania workers can outcompete the world. I pushed for the CHIPS &amp; Science Act to invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and ensure that the Commonwealth will lead the charge on 21st century technology development. https://t.co/HpMlBdEKGS

2024-10-15T20:10:49.000Z
Nearly a decade ago, I passed the ABLE Act to help people with disabilities save for their futures without losing federal benefits. Yesterday, I announced $130 million invested in PA ABLE accounts, showing how well this program is working here in the Commonwealth. https://t.co/Wk3PmZ4YzG

2024-10-14T21:34:29.000Z
When Lilly Ledbetter learned she was paid less than her male colleagues, she fought to right this injustice—not just for herself, but for all women. Her determination led to the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. My thoughts are with her family. https://t.co/G0ECFGqmAH

Families shouldn’t have to choose between caring for a loved one and economic stability - yet many are forced to make this choice. I will continue to fight on behalf of all those in need of care and the caregivers they rely on. https://t.co/wIOytUXlOw

Yesterday, I joined @GovernorShapiro at the @weitzmanmuseum to tour the Nova Exhibition and honor all those murdered and taken hostage on Oct 7. I also met with Sigal Manzuri, who lost both her daughters at the Nova Musical Festival. May we never forget that horrific day. https://t.co/7D6ReaPHFV

2024-10-08T15:26:55.000Z
While we must all strive for an end to the conflict in Gaza for Israelis and Palestinians alike, this was an insensitive and inappropriate statement on a difficult day for so many Jewish Pennsylvanians.

2024-10-08T15:26:55.000Z
I could not disagree more with this statement. Hamas is a terrorist organization and its horrific attack which resulted in the murder of 1,200 innocent Israeli civilians must be categorically condemned. Hamas remains a threat to the people of Israel. https://t.co/9cdLa9vz3g

2024-10-08T13:24:42.000Z

Led by Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah has terrorized the world for decades, including bombing  U.S. embassies and killing Americans and Israelis. 

Hassan Nasrallah's death is a measure of justice for the terror he has reigned. The U.S. continues to stand with Israel.

The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant is playing a critical role bolstering Ukraine’s forces, and I was honored to join President Zelenskyy to thank Pennsylvania workers for helping defend democracy. Attempts to smear his visit to our Commonwealth are an insult and a disgrace.

2024-09-25T15:25:18.000Z
A contract between the U.S. Navy and Gecko Robotics has been delayed for months, putting our national and economic security at risk.  I am urging @USGSA to expedite this contract that would bring more than 150 jobs to Southwestern PA and help grow the region’s defense business. https://t.co/yikn4o4CKP

2024-09-24T15:11:34.000Z
It was an honor to join Ukrainian President @ZelenskyyUa over the weekend to see the artillery shells being forged here at Scranton’s own Army Ammunition Plant and sent to Ukraine in its valiant fight against Vladimir Putin. The United States will always stand with Ukraine. https://t.co/e5ouPnYAFy

Shutting down this factory will not only cost over 300 hardworking Pennsylvanians their jobs, but will be      devastating for all the families who call Charleroi home. I'm going to exhaust all options to keep this plant open and keep these jobs in the Mon Valley.

2024-09-20T21:42:32.000Z
Anchor Hocking's recent acquisition of the Charleroi glass plant raises questions, so today, I sent a letter requesting a confidential briefing from the FTC on questions related to the plant and the private equity firm affiliated with Anchor Hocking. https://t.co/00XPxNdNI8

2024-09-20T21:42:32.000Z

Make no mistake: IVF acess is in jeopardy because of the fall of Roe v Wade. But when given the opportunity to protect access to fertility treatments today, Senate Republicans have once again failed to do so. American women know that actions speak louder than words.

Last week, Senate Republicans voted against the right to contraception, and today they voted against protecting IVF for families trying to conceive.

Actions speak louder than words. Republican politicians are again proving that they can't be trusted on reproductive rights.

2024-06-13T15:15:46.000Z
But make no mistake: reproductive rights are still under attack. Extreme politicians are going to keep pushing to ban abortion nationwide and take away the right to contraception, and we're going to fight them every step of the way.
