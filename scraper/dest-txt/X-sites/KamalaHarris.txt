Donald Trump’s stance on reproductive freedom is clear. 

He’s “proud” of overturning Roe v. Wade. And if given the chance, he will ban abortion nationwide. 

We cannot let him win.

Donald Trump’s track record for the auto industry was a disaster. As president, he promised that the auto industry would not “lose one plant” during his term. Then six auto plants closed.

Donald Trump vowed to be a dictator on day one. He vowed to use the military to carry out personal and political vendettas. His former chief of staff said he wanted generals like Hitler’s.  

Trump wants unchecked power. In 13 days, the American people will decide what they want. https://t.co/p26wvGiN4i

Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution.

The Wall Street Journal, Goldman Sachs, 16 Nobel laureates, and Moody’s compared my economic plan against Donald Trump’s. 

Their review was clear: My plan will strengthen the economy, and Trump’s will make it weaker. https://t.co/LkwBWU9Wth

Strengthening Medicare to cover home care for our nation’s seniors and those with disabilities is common sense. 

It helps family caregivers, and it strengthens our economy.

Donald Trump intends to cut off federal programs that give loans to small businesses.

Donald Trump’s Project 2025 is a plan to weaken America’s middle class.

But we won’t let him win—because we know when the middle class is strong, America is strong.

2024-09-06T15:53:02.000Z

Knock on doors.

Every day matters.

Together, we passed the first bipartisan law addressing gun violence prevention in nearly 30 years, but we have more work to do.

Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. 

Because when the middle class is strong, America is strong.

I grew up in a middle-class household. For most of my childhood, we were renters.

My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when the day finally came—and I can still remember how excited she was.

As the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well.

Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still isn’t enough.

My administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home.

2024-08-16T18:49:48.000Z
There’s a serious housing shortage.

As President, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need.

By the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.

No one should go to jail for smoking weed. 

We have pardoned tens of thousands of people with federal convictions for simple marijuana possession.

Marijuana is currently classified on the same level as heroin and more dangerous than fentanyl.

Our administration is finally changing that. https://t.co/VfpBXx3xZX

Donald Trump said he wants to leave abortion up to the states. 

Here's how that worked out: 1 in 3 women of reproductive age—including 4 million in Florida—live in a state with an abortion ban. 

He is the architect of this health care crisis.
