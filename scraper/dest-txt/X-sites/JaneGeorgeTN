First Lady Jill Biden recently said, "We have to meet this moment as if our rights are at stake, because they are. As if democracy is on the line, because it is." 
I stand ready to fight for our rights and protect our democracy in Congress.

Tim Burchett voted against the American Rescue Plan, turning his back on crucial funding for mental health services. In a time when support for mental health is more vital than ever, we must question why he would deny such essential resources to those in need.
