It is more urgent than ever that we end the war, release the innocent hostages, surge aid in Gaza, and – as I have long advocated for – be on a path toward a two-state solution that provides self-determination for the Palestinian people and peace in the region. https://t.co/DhuOIinKec

When the annual cost of child care in Wisconsin is more than in-state college tuition, we have to call this what it is: a full-blown child care crisis. I won’t stop fighting to ensure parents have access to the affordable child care they need and deserve.

2024-10-29T20:09:38.000Z

Access to clean water shouldn’t be a luxury, it’s a necessity. That’s why I was proud to vote for legislation that is putting access to clean drinking water within reach for more Wisconsin families.

Losing a child to fentanyl is something no one should ever have to go through. Sadly, I've heard from parents who have experienced this type of heartbreak. The crisis must end now. I’m calling for action against China for putting American lives at risk. https://t.co/H2J7K3xfUP

2024-10-24T15:25:08.000Z
Every family should have access to affordable child care, no matter where they live in Wisconsin. We have to tackle this crisis head on so we can get parents back to work, give kids a strong start, and lower costs for Wisconsin families. https://t.co/szKFNTdxyw

2024-10-23T20:08:45.000Z
Families should trust that the water coming out of their faucets is safe to drink, but that’s not the case for too many Wisconsinites. Together, we're going to remove lead pipes, address dangerous chemicals like PFAS, &amp; deliver clean water to families across the Badger State. https://t.co/h3qXjJKyIj

2024-10-23T15:42:00.000Z

2024-10-21T14:55:19.000Z
“A living nightmare” is not what Wisconsin women should have to say about exercising their right to control their bodies and get the health care they need. It’s time to pass my bill to restore Roe and give women their reproductive rights back.

2024-10-20T22:41:40.000Z
Whether replacing outdated service lines or getting rid of lead paint in houses, we must do more to protect our children from the lifelong effects of lead poisoning. I’m glad to have delivered funding to help Wisconsin families live in healthier environments. https://t.co/ouvD6jWrlC

Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind behind the brutal October 7th terrorist attack on Israel &amp; a barrier to peace. Justice has been served.

Under Georgia’s cruel 6-week abortion ban, women like Amber Thurman have died. Make no mistake, this is what "leave it to the states” really means.

While this is encouraging news, we know that fentanyl is still coming into our country by cars, planes, trains, and boats. I have a bill that would give our law enforcement the tools they need to detect and stop fentanyl from coming into our country.

Watching a loved one battle an opioid addiction is a struggle that I and many Wisconsin families know all too well. That’s why I’m fighting, and will keep fighting, to make sure help is available for those who need it. https://t.co/pzxkMx2ZeP

Ending the fentanyl crisis starts with preventing it from entering our country. I introduced a bill that will give law enforcement the resources they need to stop drug traffickers from using American airports, roads, rail, and ports to smuggle fentanyl into our communities. https://t.co/MxVAWPXX8s

2024-10-01T20:25:15.000Z
Iran’s attacks on Israel are entirely unacceptable and I condemn them in no uncertain terms. The U.S. must support Israel's right to defend itself against these attacks and continue to work to de-escalate the conflict to avoid an all-out war in the region.

Patients from every one of Wisconsin’s 72 counties had to travel out of state just to get the care they needed after Roe fell. While we fight to restore women’s reproductive freedoms, we should at least pass my bill to help women travel so they can control their bodies.

Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, women across America have been forced to travel across state lines to exercise their right to decide — which is costly, time-consuming, and just flat-out wrong.

The lives of women across our country have been put in jeopardy since the moment Roe v. Wade was overturned. No woman should have to be on death’s doorstep to get the lifesaving care she needs. We must pass my bill to end this chaos and give women their freedoms back. https://t.co/gsd3Vas7nm

2024-09-22T16:49:25.000Z

13 years ago, we ended the discriminatory ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy. This marked a vital step forward toward equality &amp; today our work continues. Every American who serves our country deserves to do so as their true authentic selves — no matter their sexual orientation.

IVF has given Wisconsinites the freedom to grow their families on their own terms but now that right is at risk.

(4/6) While we’ve made progress to restore reproductive rights in Wisconsin, women in the Badger State currently still live under a 20-week ban, are forced to undergo a medically unnecessary 24-hour waiting period, &amp; abortion care isn’t available in 69 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties. https://t.co/CaaOz2UqME

(2/6) Since the Dobbs decision, women seeking basic care skyrocketed &amp; were forced to burden a heavy price — with 9 out of 10 patients in 2023 seeking care out-of-state paying over $1,000 on average out-of-pocket on travel, lodging, childcare, &amp; other expenses. https://t.co/Fr43X5kjlh

Today, we honor the Americans and allied forces who turned the tide of the war and stood up to Hitler’s tyranny. We honor their sacrifice and bravery. We honor their commitment to freedom. And we honor their belief in something greater than them. #DDay https://t.co/ZRY5PXJJ0w

Today, I voted to protect access to contraception &amp; send a message to Americans that I support their right to control their bodies.

A bunch of Republicans voted no &amp; sent a chilling message to women that they don’t support that freedom.

It’s wrong &amp; this fight is far from over. https://t.co/IiYeHISnlX

When pregnant women and new moms don’t get the mental health care they need, it puts their lives at risk &amp; fails to set up their babies for success. I’m working to make it easier for new &amp; expectant mothers to get the mental &amp; substance abuse care they need to stay healthy. https://t.co/Se4QULCXL3

2024-06-05T14:51:08.000Z
Today, the Senate will vote on whether women deserve the right to contraception, and the stakes to protect women’s reproductive rights have never been higher. 

I will be voting YES because our future, our freedoms, and our bodily autonomy depends on it.

2024-06-04T22:39:35.000Z
Women should have the freedom to decide. Women shouldn’t have to be on the brink of death to get the health care they need.

2024-06-03T21:57:02.000Z
Too many Wisconsinites know the unfortunate reality that one pill can kill. Now that my FEND Off Fentanyl Act is law, we are curbing fentanyl from crossing our border, but I know we have more work to do to support our officers and first responders. https://t.co/iUhuQoXvMJ

Big Oil plays all sorts of games that jack up the price at the pump for American families and small businesses, and it’s wrong. I’m calling on @TheJusticeDept to do better to protect consumers from collusion that raises costs for working families. https://t.co/5T6z5c6wtA

Judges shouldn’t be making health care decisions for women.

Doctors shouldn’t be living in fear of prosecution for doing their jobs.

Women shouldn’t be living with fewer rights than their mothers &amp; grandmothers.

It’s way past time to pass my bill to restore Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/N1GbW1utRB

2024-05-31T18:26:46.000Z
I’ve always believed that no American should go broke just to get the medication they need to live a healthy life. Capping inhaler prices to $35/month will be much needed relief for Wisconsinites who will have costs cut from lower inhaler prices.

Everyone knows that big drug companies have been ripping off families for too long.

I am proud to have done something about it. I fought to lower inhaler costs to $35/month and now Wisconsinites like these in La Crosse will have their costs cut and can enjoy peace of mind. https://t.co/ucbO1m6Ebc

I’m proud that after I took on big inhaler companies, many Wisconsinites are saying goodbye to high health care costs and hello to inhalers that are $35/month. It was great to be in Wausau to hear how this is helping families save money and breathe a little easier. https://t.co/I8geTNf2wM

Today, I’m thinking about all of the Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice. I’m thinking about the families with an empty seat at the table. I’m thinking about the troops protecting us today.

We have a duty to do right by those who served us. Happy Memorial Day, Wisconsin.

2024-05-26T19:41:38.000Z
For too long, we’ve come up short taking care of our veterans. Our PACT Act helps turn the tides and is delivering benefits to hundreds of thousands of veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits.

Republicans and Democrats worked hard to craft a tough bipartisan deal that would secure our border, stop fentanyl from coming in, and fix parts of our immigration system. Today, I’m voting to pass this legislation and make a difference for Wisconsin.  https://t.co/n1rm59fqC1

2024-05-22T21:22:18.000Z

Women deserve the right to access comprehensive reproductive care. Republicans' overturning of Roe is exacerbating an already dire situation for women’s care in Wisconsin.

For too long, big corporations have used their exorbitant profits to enrich their wealthy shareholders instead of investing in their workers or lowering prices. It’s wrong and it’s time to rein in corporate stock buybacks that are putting profits over people. https://t.co/6NKMKTJCUy

2024-05-17T14:22:54.000Z
Our bipartisan border bill would’ve helped secure our border &amp; stop fentanyl from coming into the country. This compromise would have taken meaningful steps to fix our broken immigration system but politics as usual got in the way. It’s wrong &amp; we need to come back to the table.
