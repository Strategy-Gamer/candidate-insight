Assess the threat, most may need counseling, few will need to be charged with felonies.

2024-10-30T18:18:43.000Z
And we aren‚Äôt supposed to write bad laws hoping District Attorneys and Judges save us from harming kids. Don‚Äôt write legislation hoping some judge makes the right call. Don‚Äôt charge a 7 yr old with a felony for saying something wild, they do it all day long.

2024-10-30T18:18:43.000Z
The trauma caused by cuffing &amp; arresting young kids does irreparable damage. Decent people don‚Äôt sacrifice kids to teach others a lesson. That is an ignorant response from the Speaker. 8 year olds across TN aren‚Äôt reading the paper and saying, ‚Äúwell, I won‚Äôt do that next time.‚Äù

2024-10-30T18:18:42.000Z
Children‚Äôs brains are developing, they lash out when they are hurt or bullied, saying the first thing that comes to their mind, not even understanding what they are saying, with zero intention of acting out at all.

2024-10-30T18:18:42.000Z
I asked for changes in this legislation precisely because of circumstances outlined in this article. I could not support it as is. And to hear Sexton say we have to ‚Äúmake examples‚Äù of 7-11 year olds, charging them with felonies, it‚Äôs a travesty.

2024-10-22T17:27:53.000Z
@ChadMichaels1 @currermell @antifaoperative The goal is for the person to never do it again-life without parole does this. The other concern is the mental health of the child. If the perp is sentenced to death, the child will have to show up to court multiple times a year for appeals and relive the trauma.

2024-10-22T17:24:48.000Z
@ChadMichaels1 @currermell @antifaoperative Child rape is a 100% time crime and already carries a life without parole sentence.

Using trauma informed approaches-address trauma to prevent trauma. Also, evidence informed practices and victim compensation programs.

Raising the wage causes a drop of up to 10% in violent crime, especially in juveniles and young adults.

2024-10-13T03:56:30.000Z
Expanding Medicaid resulted in a decrease of 19-29% of violent crime in states that expanded and a decrease of 25-41% of drug crime. It saved states 1-5 billion dollars. Remember having access to healthcare includes mental healthcare.

We know that the majority of residents end up staying where they do their residency. It‚Äôs only a matter of a few years before half of TN has no ob/gyn and it will only get worse as fewer come to our state to train.

Since the Dobbs decision, medical residents coming to TN medical schools have decreased by 21%. They can‚Äôt get the full practice they need to be certified in TN, so they aren‚Äôt coming to TN.

Well over 1/3 of TN counties have no ob/gyn in their county, nor a hospital with a delivery room. Imagine forcing women and girls to carry a pregnancy with the care they need an hour to hour and a half away. Women and girls lives are put at risk in TN with the GOP ticket.

2024-10-02T20:31:22.000Z
TN has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country and children carrying a pregnancy die at 2 times the rate of adult women carrying a pregnancy. Yet this state will force a child or woman to carry a pregnancy that risks their life.

2024-10-02T20:31:21.000Z
This trifecta of terror for TN women and girls gives a violent rapist more rights than a victim of a violent rape. A rapist can choose the mother of his child, but a woman or girl can‚Äôt choose not to have her rapist‚Äôs baby, being victimized again by the state.

TN families deserve better, we need to lift families into the middle class instead of having them fall out of the middle class. TNeans will see what a good job with good benefits does for families as we see more and more union jobs in TN! #UnionStrong

I met a second woman in Kingsport who works in VA because she makes $20k more a year in VA at the same job she had in TN. We need good jobs with good wages so families earn a living wage.

2024-09-02T16:17:48.000Z
She and her husband both go to jobs in other states. One drives an hour to work in Boone, NC, the other drives 45 minutes into Virginia each day. VA‚Äôs minimum wage is $12 an hour instead of the $7.25 in TN.

2024-09-02T16:17:47.000Z
She was able to go back to get a degree so she could get a better job, yet there were no jobs in her town/state with better salaries. She still couldn‚Äôt work in TN and afford child care.

2024-09-02T16:17:47.000Z
Since it‚Äôs #LaborDay2024, I want to talk about a couple I met Saturday in Mountain City. They had kids and struggled to make ends meet on the salaries they earned in Mountain City. The mom wasn‚Äôt working because she couldn‚Äôt make enough in TN to afford childcare while working.

2024-09-02T15:26:04.000Z
Sounds like his first love told him there was no way in hell she was having his kids and he never got over it, so this is the story he tells himself. #blesshisheart

Teachers in TN are making less today than 10 years ago when you factor in cost of living increase. They can't afford to live where they teach and we have a dire teacher shortage because of this and the constant demeaning of our teachers by the GOP.

In Knoxville, homicides r down more than 30%.  Non fatal shootings (a precursor to homicides) are down 40%. This is due largely to community based efforts. A large portion of this year‚Äôs homicides are domestic violence cases which wld benefit from red flag laws.
