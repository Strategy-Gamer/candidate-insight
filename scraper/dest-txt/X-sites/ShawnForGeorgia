Marjorie Taylor Greene just told millions of Americans that they struggle financially because of immigrants.

1) Why do you lie?

2) Why were you among the loudest voices to block the bipartisan bill in Congress to fix our immigration system?

3) When will the incitement STOP?

2024-07-16T00:44:32.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene used her platform at the Republican National Convention tonight to incite and stoke division among millions of Americans watching.

I'm outraged that MTG doubles down with her rhetoric at a moment when we must do everything to unite as Americans.

2024-07-15T02:53:21.000Z
And let us find the leadership we need to bring America through this moment and into a stronger and more prosperous future.

May God bless the United States of America, and may God grant us the wisdom always to recognize each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.

2024-07-15T02:53:19.000Z
For today, let us reflect on the bullet America just dodged, and give thanks for the opportunity to do better in the days and years to come.

Let us reflect and turn away from the abyss that the rhetoric of violence pulls us towards.

2024-07-15T02:53:18.000Z
Leadership matters.

We need leadership that recognizes that Americans can and will disagree sometimes, but are not each other‚Äôs enemies.

Seeking to intensify anger and create conflict and widen divisions is not leadership. It is demagoguery.

2024-07-15T02:53:16.000Z
We hear our fellow Americans called disgusting, called traitors, called sick, called enemies of America.

Even if there were no chance of those words ever stirring unstable people to violence, they would still be damaging to the America we all share.

2024-07-15T02:53:15.000Z
Too often today in our politics we hear rhetoric that makes that mistake.

We all get passionate about politics sometimes, and that is not a bad thing. But we need to recognize what is helpful and what is not.

2024-07-15T02:53:14.000Z
In the Army, you fight alongside fellow soldiers of all backgrounds and political persuasions.

As soldiers, we understand how to disagree and still work together without ever mistaking a fellow American for an enemy.

2024-07-15T02:53:12.000Z
For some, it can lead to panic and poor decision-making at exactly the moment when level-headed thinking is most critical to the shared mission. Clear thinking in moments of fear is the job of a leader.

Today, we need clear thinking.

There are two historical events relating to our democracy.

July 4, 1776: We declared independence from Great Britain and the birth of our nation.

MTG shamefully compared the two. https://t.co/F48C3IZBtb

MTG MUST GO!!!

We can't allow her to continue endangering our democracy. Our grassroots have helped us build a strong foundation, and we must keep up the momentum.

Our end-of-month deadline is in just a few days. Can you chip in $7, $20.24, or $50 today?https://t.co/M6Qyitrxp0

I‚Äôve served this country my entire life. Now I‚Äôm a civilian, but that doesn‚Äôt mean my tasks are complete.

My mission is to restore sanity to Congress by removing its most chaotic member.

America deserves better than Marjorie Taylor Greene.

2024-05-27T23:43:50.000Z
This Memorial Day, we remember those who sacrificed their lives to defend our nation. Today, I'm thinking of the many soldiers I served with who died protecting our most valued freedoms.

Let us never forget the price that they paid so that we can be free. https://t.co/CcbmePodxN

2024-05-26T23:34:58.000Z
I'm running against Marjorie Taylor Greene because every day she sits in Congress, she's a threat and a danger to our democracy.

Unlike MTG, my priority will be the people of North Georgia, not headlines.

Unlike MTG, I'm going to work together, not against my colleagues.

Unlike MTG, I won't insult people or other groups every other day.

Unlike MTG, I'll honor our flag and fight to defend our democracy.

2024-05-26T04:19:19.000Z
MTG endangers our democracy at home and abroad by glorifying Jan 6 insurrectionists and Putin.

I served 40 years in the military, and it's my patriotic duty to unseat MTG.

Can you chip in $7 before our end-of-month deadline and help save our democracy?https://t.co/t6tXtd8uc8

2024-05-26T04:00:38.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene should stop lying and say that she's all for America first.

MTG is for Russia first.

Thank you for the win in Polk County. I appreciate all you did, and I know I have you with me for the June 18th runoff.

Marjorie Taylor Greene asks to fly the flag upside-down. As usual, she's running her mouth about things she doesn't understand.

I'll never forget Pres. Reagan's speech in my early military days about why we honor our flag.

MTG owes an apology to every veteran in North Georgia. https://t.co/nrBw1125Tw

2024-05-24T02:53:50.000Z
MTG peddles conspiracies about the president and shamelessly urges flying our flag upside-down.

She's proving every day that she doesn‚Äôt understand what service and leadership mean.

I served with courageous leaders, and I‚Äôm proud to have been able to support them then and now. https://t.co/FX0Nyu2RPQ

MTG is all for "America first" and "law and order," but keeps praising the Jan 6 insurrectionists.

2024-05-23T02:53:53.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene promoting the US flag upside-down is just her latest slap in the face to North Georgia veterans like myself.

MTG is Russia's puppet in Congress, praises Jan 6 rioters, and insults our flag. And then she has the audacity to talk about putting America first?

2024-05-22T16:47:48.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene is trying to hide the negative impact her silly behavior has on everyday Georgians.

Good morning, Georgia.

I can't stop thinking of all the people I met at the polls yesterday who feel they have no representation in Washington.

Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn't serve the people of Northwest Georgia, but herself.

I say it every year after the President's State of the Union, and I'm saying it now again.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is embarrassing the people of Northwest Georgia in front of the entire nation.

I'm now even more energized to run for Congress and defeat MTG.

2024-05-09T05:27:02.000Z
MTG's running scared.

She knows that Georgians are frustrated with her chaos and drama while failing to deliver anything substantial to the people of Northwest Georgia.

Can you chip in $20.24 or any amount you can afford to get rid of MTG in 2024? https://t.co/LbT9HumH3X

2024-05-09T03:09:00.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene is a chaos agent and a national embarrassment and doesn't belong in Congress.

Pass it on.

My opponent MTG raises money from her radical fan club, who watch her on Steve Bannon's show and eat up her foolish stunts like candy.

Our campaign is powered by people who care for our democracy. Our avg. donation is $27.54.

OUTRAGEOUS: Rather than focusing on so many pressing issues facing our country at home and abroad, Congress was forced to deal with another day of drama by my opponent, the chaos agent, Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Watch MTG turn Congress into a kindergarten. https://t.co/3KbYp4dwWy

2024-05-08T23:08:23.000Z
Marjorie Taylor Greene will do anything to get a few minutes of fame on radical shows like OANN, Newsmax, and Steve Bannon.

MTG lives and breathes chaos and isn't interested in governing or delivering anything substantial for the people of Northwest Georgia.

2024-05-08T22:54:12.000Z
I'm running against the chaos agent and the most toxic member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene.

BREAKING NEWS: In a bipartisan move, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly defeated (359‚Äì43) my opponent and chaos agent, Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson.

MTG's next defeat will be when I beat her on November 5th.

2024-05-08T17:17:47.000Z
The 118th Congress is the least productive in modern history. Despite holding over 700 votes, only 27 made it into law in 2023.

Marjorie Taylor Greene insists on lighting the House of Representatives on fire and continuing the chaos and dysfunction.

MTG must be defeated.

2024-05-08T15:58:06.000Z
Women with high-risk pregnancies are in extra danger due to a lack of nearby OB-GYN's here in North Georgia.

It is the year of our Lord, 2024. Georgians should be able to have a child without putting their own lives at risk.

In Congress, I'm going to take action.

2024-05-08T15:43:48.000Z

MTG has millions of followers, I don't.

Mainly because I'm not a chaos agent, nor do I peddle conspiracies on Steve Bannon's show every day.

Can you give us a hand to help us archive our goal to reach 100,000 followers before MTG moves with her motion to vacate?

15,000 to go. https://t.co/BGvWU0XmLU

2024-05-07T21:57:38.000Z
MTG says she'll need to raise more money in this election than ever before.

She's running scared because she sees the momentum we're gaining in North Georgia.

Can you chip in whatever you can afford right now, even $1, to counter MTG's radical fan club?

BOOM! Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying the quiet part out loud:

She's in it for the money. The worse she acts, the better she does, because she gets more attention and raises more cash from her radical fan club.

She's never done anything for Georgians. Now she's told us why. https://t.co/SxBnzxA0MN

2024-05-07T02:58:04.000Z
Seven bucks may not seem like a lot to unseat Marjorie Taylor Greene.

But when it becomes one of the thousands of monthly grassroots donations to save our democracy, it sure is.

Marjorie Taylor Greene causing chaos isn't new. MTG was a chaos agent before she was even sworn in. Listen to her own words before Jan. 6, 2021.

MTG is a danger to our democracy and must be defeated.

North Georgia has so many hard-working men and women. What we need are better job opportunities.

When I get to Congress, I'm going to focus on bringing high-paying, generational jobs to Northwest Georgia.

Whether you have a GED or a PHD, everyone deserves a chance in life. https://t.co/tRLcfQDXzA

2024-05-06T02:40:49.000Z
Who said Marjorie Taylor Greene wasn't a unifier?

This week in Congress, Democrats and Republicans are uniting to table her motion to vacate the Speaker.

On Nov 5th, in Georgia, Democrats and Republicans are uniting to kick her out of office.

üö® ENDORSEMENT ALERT üö® 

The military is made up of a diverse group of individuals dedicated to serving our country.

Common Defense provides a multi-generational, multi-racial space for these men and women to continue their service.

I'm so proud to receive their endorsement. https://t.co/hGSTLTVq1C

2024-05-06T00:52:16.000Z
MTG, get it straight.

Former President Trump is standing side-by-side with Speaker Johnson -- against you, and he isn't hiding it.

All across our great country, people are tired of your foolishness. Democrats and Republicans alike.

Chaos is not popular. https://t.co/ObRGab86tE
