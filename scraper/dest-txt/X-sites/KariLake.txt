From what we're learning about this attempted assassin, he fell hook, line, &amp; sinker for every piece of anti-MAGA propaganda the media &amp; the left have been spewing for years.

It has to stop.

Two impeachments, four indictments, now two assassination attempts, &amp; President Trump is stronger than ever. 

But this attack wasn't just about him. It's about his movement, a movement of peace, common sense, &amp; positivity that has been demonized by the propaganda press.
