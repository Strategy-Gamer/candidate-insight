Rick Scott has shown us how dangerous he is, he will always put his extremist agenda over democracy. We owe it to Floridians to protect their voices this election, and that starts by voting Scott out of the Senate. https://t.co/JozfAsLe7N

Let me tell you, West Palm Beach is fed up with attacks on their Social Security and Medicare, and sky rocketing every day costs. They‚Äôre ready for a future where we can thrive, rather than be fearful about which of our rights Rick Scott will attack next.

This is the same dangerous, anti-Semitic trope we've seen throughout history.

Rick Scott won't even say the words climate change! 

He can strip the words from Florida state laws but the reality is that our coastal communities are threatened and workers are outside in dangerous conditions. That's the disastrous future he and Trump want for our state.

"Let it ROT."

Rick Scott joined Donald Trump in calling to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They would strip health care from OVER FOUR MILLION Floridians. We're not letting that happen.

NO M√ÅS. Our communities are being destroyed by gun violence and extremist leaders in FL only make guns *more* accessible to anyone without a permit, a license, or background check. In the Senate, I‚Äôll fight for common sense gun safety regulations. https://t.co/s9MexUjj0c

Floridians are bearing the brunt of skyrocketing insurance rates &amp; a crisis caused by Rick Scott. While he's getting richer off of Big Oil, it's Floridians who are being forced to leave the state or go uninsured.

2024-06-15T14:22:09.000Z
Rick Scott banned the words ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù from state records &amp; voted against $1.5 Billion in funding infrastructure prep for extreme weather. He can ignore the climate crisis all he wants, but it‚Äôs Floridians dealing with the consequences of a month's worth of rain in 3 days.

2024-06-15T01:38:13.000Z
While I‚Äôm fighting to protect Floridians‚Äô rights, Rick Scott‚Äôs headlined THE national conference for a far-right group best known for being ‚Äúinfested with anti-semitism‚Äù and ‚Äúrife‚Äô with racism.‚Äù That‚Äôs the difference this November.

Americans‚Äô average annual insurance price = $2,153
Florida‚Äôs average annual insurance price = $6,366

Floridians are paying nearly TRIPLE the annual rate on homeowners insurance because of Rick Scott‚Äôs insurance crisis. https://t.co/e02tkfsroB

2024-05-14T13:29:39.000Z
So many Floridians recognize the attacks on our rights for what they are, because we have left authoritarian countries in search of those rights. This November, we are going to fight for our rights at the ballot box.  https://t.co/fXJVHdYxXs

2024-05-14T00:14:40.000Z
DeSantis and Rick Scott‚Äôs dangerous abortion ban will force young victims of human trafficking who've been raped or sexually abused to carry unwanted pregnancies. These laws do nothing, but further control the lives of women and incite more violence. https://t.co/BazJpL5PEG

Shady Oligarch Rick Scott stole hundreds of millions of dollars from Medicare then used the money to buy the Governor's Mansion and a Senate seat. Floridians will send him packing in November. https://t.co/sDtLgusMwa

My story is one that‚Äôs reflected all around Florida. I went from working a minimum wage job to serving in Congress. Now, I‚Äôm running for Senate to protect the very opportunities that empowered me.

Florida‚Äôs worth fighting for. Are you with us?

2024-05-12T18:54:00.000Z
Florida‚Äôs abortion ban is a disaster for FL‚Äôs doctors and patients. Future physicians won‚Äôt receive the training they need, and they WILL look elsewhere. https://t.co/SKNDsQ5YWx

Scott oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in history and tried to say he‚Äôs the victim? It‚Äôs another one of his lies ‚Äî no amount of groveling to Trump &amp; shouting of conspiracy theories will work. Floridians see right through him. https://t.co/FmJPFGNhVo

We said goodbye to Bob Graham today ‚Äî a true powerhouse of Florida. He championed our communities, our environment, our economy &amp; workers, and our democracy. He fought for what was right and just, and is the blueprint for public service in Florida. He was the best of our state,

Of course Rick Scott supports his "friend" Trump. They‚Äôre both frauds who think their money means they‚Äôre above the law, but they've been caught &amp; have to live w/ the consequences ‚Äî b/c NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

P.S. Rick, it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre using Trump for your political gain. https://t.co/ol1gmtItFg

While Rick Scott was in New York making a mockery of our justice system, I‚Äôm in FL with @MexAmCouncil, who‚Äôs doing the work to empower our communities.

It was a great night at the 40th Annual Farmworker Student Recognition Ceremony honoring these scholars for their hard work. https://t.co/bmlq0SnNzA

2024-05-09T22:11:00.000Z
Rather than fighting for Floridians who are struggling in Florida, Rick Scott‚Äôs now a puppet for Trump. He‚Äôs a joke. https://t.co/qnPR5DraK5

2024-05-09T18:31:14.000Z
Rick skipped out on the FAA authorization consideration vote and the job taxpayers pay him to do. Here‚Äôs where he was instead: in court kissing up to Donald Trump. https://t.co/CErHtpJLQz

2024-05-09T15:35:31.000Z
Rick Scott knows what it's like to be on trial because his company committed the largest Medicare fraud in the history of this country. Now he's skipping out on the job taxpayers pay him for to help his corrupt MAGA boss in court.

They're both corrupt embarrassments to the U.S. https://t.co/GS26FwhZI9

2024-05-09T14:05:04.000Z
Rick Scott and Donald Trump think their money puts them above the law. 

Floridian families are struggling, but Rick Scott doesn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs in New York to support Trump in court. That‚Äôs not leadership. He's the lowest of the low. https://t.co/zWn7Di2Mo1

Extremists in FL &amp; DC are pushing authoritarian laws that so many of us have fled from. They‚Äôre silencing opposition, instilling fear and suppressing our vote. It's time for change in FL ‚Äî with the right investments in this movement, we'll win big in November &amp; move FL forward.

2024-05-09T00:10:10.000Z
Trump LOST 18% of GOP voters in the FL primary. I‚Äôve talked to voters across the political spectrum, and they‚Äôve consistently said that they‚Äôre tired of the fighting and ready for change. https://t.co/60t7cVLbUR

.@DonnaDeegan flipped the Jax Mayor‚Äôs seat blue for the 1st time in 3 decades. And @KeenForFL flipped a GOP-held seat in Orange &amp; Osceola counties.

Voters are FED UP with extremists‚Äô control over our rights, and are ready for change. https://t.co/tRsyqir3OG

2024-05-09T00:10:09.000Z
Rick Scott has stripped millions of women of their reproductive freedoms ‚Äî¬†and now he‚Äôs terrified of the consequences of his actions.  When abortion access is on the ballot, freedom wins. 

Scott is scrambling b/c Floridians know his awful record on abortion. https://t.co/xI5DCw8PeJ

2024-05-09T00:10:08.000Z
Rick Scott is the MOST VULNERABLE GOP Senator this cycle. He‚Äôs anti-choice, anti-environment, anti-Social Security and Medicare, and only pro-Rick Scott. 

Democrats &amp; Republicans all agree ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt like Rick Scott. https://t.co/Ece58qQNM9

Floridians are bearing the brunt of an insurance crisis created by Rick Scott ‚Äî¬†many are forced to either leave the state or go uninsured.

As a mother, I've seen the impact of educators going above and beyond for their students. This Teacher Appreciation Week, we must commit to defending those in Florida who do the work because they care so deeply about defending our future generations against extremist attacks.

During my time as the Associate Dean of the FIU medical school, I learned that there‚Äôs no one more selfless ‚Äî or critical to our health ‚Äî than our nurses. This National Nurses week, I thank our nurses for the tireless work they do to advocate for their patients.

2024-05-06T19:40:00.000Z
We‚Äôre going to see an increase in violence against women and maternal mortality rates because patients can‚Äôt make the decisions they need to about their bodies.

Rick Scott backed this abortion ban and he‚Äôll push a national abortion ban again if he‚Äôs sent back to the Senate. https://t.co/MtEaVQGrc6
