- Rent is up 22.5 percent

2024-10-02T01:21:42.000Z
Tim Walz sat back and did nothing while Minneapolis burned in 2020. 

Tim Walz put political pandering over the safety of Americans then, and he will do the same as Vice President. 

We cannot trust him to secure our border or stop the crime epidemic.

Inflation - a tax on all Americans - is directly caused by Washington Democrats‚Äô reckless spending. We need to elect strong conservatives up and down the ballot in November to turn our economy around.
