No one person can win this Senate campaign alone. It will take all of us. Together. Add your name to say you endorse Ruben Gallego for Senate.
Ruben Gallego is the son of immigrants who was raised by a single mom on a secretary’s pay alongside his three sisters. Growing up, he worked whatever job he could find to help support his family— at a pizza joint, construction sites, and a meatpacking plant — before earning a spot at Harvard. Ruben deployed to Iraq in 2005 where his company saw some of the highest casualties of the war. A Marine combat veteran, Ruben was elected to the Arizona State House in 2010 and the U.S. House in 2014 where he has served as a voice for Arizona’s veterans, hardworking families, and seniors for over a decade. Ruben is married and lives in South Phoenix with his wife Sydney, son Michael and daughter Isla.
He can trace his drive to succeed to the first night he slept on the floor in the apartment his mother got for him and  his sisters after his father left. Lying there, he remembers thinking “my life sucked and I am not going to stand for that.” Growing up poor, he took advantage of the things Democrats championed and the people of our country provided: Pell Grants and school lunch programs to name two. Those helping hands gave him (and people like him) a debt of gratitude he worked to pay back through service — first in the Marines, and now in Congress.
After high school, Ruben Gallego went to Harvard where he cleaned other students’ bathrooms, worked at a meat packing plant and was a reservist during college to afford school. He later used his money saved while fighting in Iraq to pay off the $15,000 he had left in debt.
Ruben deployed to Iraq as a United States Marine Infantryman in 2005 where his company saw some of the hardest fighting and the heaviest casualties of the Iraq War, losing 22 Marines and a Navy Corpsman in eight months. Ruben wrote a book about his time overseas titled They Called Us “Lucky” — a story about his time in Iraq and the people he served with from blue-collar towns, immigrant households and the Navajo Nation. It also detailed how he has dealt with PTSD since coming back from Iraq.
Ruben’s military service motivated him to seek public office, where he has worked tirelessly to ensure that members of the military are never again sent into harm’s way without a plan for winning the fight and caring for those service members when they return home. Ruben got his start in politics working on ballot initiatives in Phoenix and went on to serve as a Chief of Staff for a member of the Phoenix City Council and Vice Chair of the Arizona Democratic Party. He was elected to the Arizona State House in 2010 and to the United States House of Representatives in 2014.

Ruben can trace his drive to succeed to the first night he slept on the living room floor in the apartment his mother got for the family after his father left. Lying there, he remembers thinking that he needed to fight for a better life for himself and his family. From that day forward, he set out to change things, taking whatever job he could find to help support his family and work his way to a better life.
After high school, Ruben earned a spot at Harvard, where he cleaned his peers’ bathrooms and stacked books at the library to afford school supplies.
Ruben deployed to Iraq as a United States Marine Infantryman in 2005 where his company saw some of the hardest combat and the heaviest casualties of the Iraq War, losing 22 Marines and a Navy Corpsman in eight months.
Ruben's military service motivated him to seek a life of continued service, where he has worked tirelessly to ensure that members of the military are never again sent into harm's way without a plan for winning the fight and caring for our servicemembers when they return home. Ruben got his start in politics working on ballot initiatives to preserve Arizonans’ rights and freedoms before serving the City of Phoenix, then being elected to the Arizona State House, and later going to the United States House of Representatives, where he has proudly served his Maricopa County community for a decade.
In the years since Ruben served our country in combat as a Marine, he has dedicated his life to public service — working to make life better for hardworking Arizona families. As a Congressman, he’s made that clear. Ruben has stood up and advocated for Arizona values at every turn. In the House, Ruben is particularly proud of the work he has done to increase access to health care, cut costs of everything from gas to groceries, defend democracy in the face of relentless far-right challenges, strengthen our national security through his role as the Chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, and bring federal funding and jobs home to Arizona. Now, Ruben is running for Senate because Arizona is at a crossroads. Protecting abortion access, housing affordability, our water supply — there is so much at stake. In the Senate, he will continue to bring people together to support Arizona families in every corner of our state — from Douglas and Parker to Phoenix and our 22 federally recognized tribes.

Ninguna persona puede ganar esta campaña del Senado por sí sola. Nos tocará a todos y todas. Juntos. Agregue su nombre para decir que apoya a Rubén Gallego para el Senado.
Rubén Gallego es hijo de madre inmigrante de Colombia y padre inmigrante de México. Creció pobre en Chicago criado por su madre junto con sus tres hermanas. Rubén fue destacado a Irak en 2005, donde su compañía vio algunos de los combates más duros de la guerra. Fue elegido para la Cámara de Representantes del Estado de Arizona en 2010 y para la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos en 2014, donde se ha desempeñado como portavoz de veteranos/as y familias trabajadoras. Ruben está casado y vive en el sur de Phoenix con su esposa Sydney, su hijo Michael y una  bebé en camino.
Rubén puede encontrar el origen de su deseo de tener éxito en la primera noche que durmió en el piso del departamento que su madre consiguió para él y sus hermanas después que su padre se fuera. Acostado allí, recuerda haber pensado “mi vida está fatal  y no lo voy a tolerar”. Al crecer en la pobreza, aprovechó las cosas que defendían los demócratas y que proporcionaban la gente de nuestro país: Becas Pell y programas de almuerzos escolares, por nombrar dos ejemplos. Esas manos amigas le dieron a él (y a personas como él) una deuda de gratitud que trabajó para retribuir  a través del servicio, primero en la Infantería de Marina y ahora en el Congreso.
Después de la secundaria, Rubén Gallego fue a Harvard, donde limpió los baños de otros estudiantes, trabajó en una planta empacadora de carne y fue reservista durante la universidad para poder pagar la universidad. Más adelante usó el dinero ahorrado mientras combatía en Irak para pagar los $15,000 que aún debía.
Rubén fue destacado a  Irak como Infante de la Marina de los Estados Unidos en 2005, donde su compañía vio algunos de los combates más duros y las mayores bajas de la guerra de Irak: perdieron 22 infantes de marina y un miembro del cuerpo médico de la Marina en ocho meses. Rubén escribió un libro sobre su tiempo en el extranjero titulado “Nos llamaron ‘afortunados’”, una historia sobre su tiempo en Irak y las personas de pueblos obreros, de hogares inmigrantes y de la Nación Navajo con quienes sirvió. También detalló cómo ha lidiado con el TEPT (PTSD por sus siglas en inglés) desde que regresó de Irak.
El servicio militar de Rubén lo motivó a buscar un cargo público, donde ha trabajado incansablemente para garantizar que los miembros de las fuerzas armadas nunca más sean puestos en peligro sin un plan para ganar la pelea y cuidar de esos miembros del servicio cuando regresen a casa. Rubén se inició en la política trabajando en iniciativas electorales en Phoenix y luego se desempeñó como Jefe de Gabinete de un miembro del Concejo Municipal de Phoenix y Vicepresidente del Partido Demócrata de Arizona. Fue elegido para la Casa del Estado de Arizona en 2010 y para la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos en 2014.

A Marine through and through, Ruben has never backed down from a fight—especially when it comes to fighting for Arizona families. A father of two, Ruben has always been a staunch supporter of the child tax credit, which provides a much needed tax-break for everyday Arizona families. In Congress, he introduced the Universal Full-Day Kindergarten Act to ensure every child has access to high-quality, full- day kindergarten. He’s also championed lower health care costs, including prescription drug reform to make sure Arizona families can always access high quality health care. He has been a vocal advocate for making housing more affordable — knowing that the everyday Arizona family can no longer afford the average Arizona home — and pushed Congress to bring home the federal resources needed to build more of it.
As Arizona continues to grow, Ruben is working to ensure opportunities for our families to grow with it.

For every Arizonan looking toward the future, water is a top priority. As our state gets hotter and drier with each passing year, Ruben is leading efforts to combat excess urban heat and find solutions to ensure our state has enough water.
To that end, he has introduced federal legislation to keep foreign corporations and governments like Saudi Arabia from using excess water in drought-stricken states like Arizona. In 2022, he also introduced the Excess Urban Heat Mitigation Bill, which directs funds to climate resiliency in major cities. Ruben recognizes that 21st century water problems require 21st century solutions, which is why he introduced a bill to support and fund emerging water conservation technologies.
To protect our public lands and water, he co-authored the 30×30 Initiative, a comprehensive plan to conserve 30% of our global lands and oceans by the year 2030. And he successfully advocated for permanent authorization and funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), a cornerstone public land program that protects critical drinking water sources across the country.
Ruben knows that a safe and healthy future for our families depends on sustainable water access. He’ll fight for that access as Arizona’s next Senator.

Ruben knows that our healthcare system is broken. Health care is a human right, and in the wealthiest nation on the planet, it is unacceptable that high-quality, comprehensive health care is not accessible for all Arizonans.
Ruben has long been a champion for improving health care access for families. He is an unwavering supporter of Medicaid expansion, and he stood up to Republican attempts to gut Arizona’s Medicaid program and dismantle the Affordable Care Act time and again.
For seniors, Ruben was proud to pass lower prescription drug prices as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. He will continue to stand up to any attempt to privatize or cut Medicare on behalf of the 1.45 million Arizonans who rely on it—and he will fight every day to expand Medicare benefits.
In Congress, Ruben has led the fight to lower health care costs—including prescription drug reform—to make sure Arizona families can always access high quality health care. And as a Senator, he will not stop until every Arizonan has access to high quality health care.

Ruben understands what it means to be an American veteran—he is one. After coming home from fighting in Iraq, where he was an infantryman in one of the hardest hit units of the war, Ruben experienced firsthand the need for better financial, medical, and social support to meet veteran community needs. We must continue to honor those who sacrifice the most, even and especially when they return home.
As a former member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee in Congress, Ruben has vocally supported programs to get veterans the housing, education, economic opportunity, and mental and physical health care they deserve. From the historic Honoring Our PACT Act which will provide benefits to veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, to his Restore Veterans’ Compensation Act which will allow veterans to keep their separation pay should they qualify for VA disability, Ruben remains committed to our veterans in Arizona and across the country.
As a veteran who has struggled with PTSD, he knows how important the VA is to Arizona veterans, but only if it works how it’s supposed to. He has introduced legislation to improve VA oversight, including patient care data and public records requests, so the veteran community and Congress know how to improve the VA for those who served.
The brave men and women who have served in uniform—and their families, who are too often forgotten or ignored—put their lives on the line to defend our freedom. Ruben will continue to be their champion and voice in the Senate.

As the former Chair and a current member of the Subcommittee for Indian and Insular Affairs, Ruben is a passionate voice for Arizona’s tribes in Congress.
He has worked tirelessly to improve access to quality healthcare for tribal communities. He wrote the Coverage for Urban Indian Health Providers Act to insure Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), and the Urban Indian Health Facilities Improvement Act, to support their infrastructure – successfully securing votes to sign both bills into law. He was a leader in the push for advanced funding for Urban Indian Health Organizations and the Indian Health Service to protect Indian Country from future government shutdowns.
Ruben is committed to helping tribal communities protect themselves, including by addressing the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW). He led a bipartisan effort to have the government’s top watchdog align federal, state, and tribal agencies to address MMIW cases and held the first congressional hearing on the crisis. He also works to improve tribal law enforcement through his bill, the BADGES in Native Communities Act, to increase coordination between federal, state, and tribal law enforcement.
Ruben knows that too many Native Americans in rural areas, including tribal lands, often lack access to vital resources – and he’s made progress to close that gap. Ruben’s PAVA Program Inclusion Act improves access to the ballot for Native Americans with disabilities living in the four corners region. He also successfully advocated for the inclusion of robust broadband deployment for Indian Country in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and he wants to do even more to expand broadband on tribal lands through his Bridging the Tribal Digital Divide Act.
