On May 24, 1949, pediatrician Morris Cohen and his wife Genevieve welcomed Stephen Ira Cohen into the world, the fourth generation of their family to live in the city of Memphis.
On May 24, 1949, pediatrician Morris Cohen and his wife Genevieve welcomed Stephen Ira Cohen into the world, the fourth generation of their family to live in the city of Memphis. Steve took an early interest in politics at the age of five when stricken with polio. When he was eleven years old, John Fitzgerald Kennedy came to Memphis on a campaign stop, and Steve took a picture of him that still hangs in his office to this day. After graduating from the Cecil Humphreys School of Law at the University of Memphis, Steve became a legal advisor for the Memphis Police Department, while simultaneously serving as vice president of the 1977 Tennessee Constitutional Convention. From 1978-80, he served as Shelby County Commissioner. While a commissioner, he was a key player behind the establishment of The Med. And in 1982, he was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly as State Senator from District 30. As a Tennessee State Senator, he fought for eighteen years to overturn the state’s ban on lotteries so he could establish a scholarship fund for the children of Tennessee. In 2002, his efforts came to fruition, and the following year, the Hope Scholarship became a reality. Thousands of students from across Tennessee are attending college because of his hard work. He also championed bills granting greater access to medical care, the protection of animal welfare, the reinstatement of voting rights, funding for the arts, and graduated drivers licenses throughout his tenure in the state senate. In 2006, Steve announced that he would seek the 9th Congressional District seat in the House of Representatives previously held by Harold Ford, Jr. He won a hotly contested primary in August of that year before going on to win the general election in November. Since being sworn in on January 4, 2007, Steve has played an active role in the House of Representatives. He voted for each portion of the Democratic Party’s “Six for ’06”, which raised the Federal Minimum Wage for the first time in a decade, enacted the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, broke the ties between lawmakers and lobbyists, halved the interest rates on student loans, ended tax subsidies to the oil companies, and granted federal funding for stem cell research. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he grilled then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales over his attempt to pressure US Attorneys into partisan prosecutions. He has used his role as a congressman to champion greater access to medical care for children, lower Medicare drug prices, lower interest rates on student loans, and an official apology for slavery and the system of segregation-era laws that restricted the rights of African-Americans and to consistently stand up to President George W. Bush over his failed policies in Iraq. Because of his work ethic, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referred to Cohen as “the conscience of the freshman class” in 2008. In August 2008, Cohen won the Democratic Congressional Primary by a huge margin, all but guaranteeing another term in Congress. In November of 2008, he won the General Election overwhelmingly In December 2008, Cohen was elected Regional Whip for the 111th Congress. He also traveled to Madrid, Spain to accept an award from The Vida Foundation honoring his bill that called upon the House of Representatives to apologize for its role in allowing slavery and the segregation era. In January 2009, He became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. He has since introduced legislation calling for an examination of racial disparity in the criminal justice system, as well as a bill to prohibit the use of credit checks in pre-employment screening.

Congressman Steve Cohen and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) sponsored an amendment to the Omnibus Fiscal Year 2016 Spending Bill to add an additional $4 million to the budget for relieving the rape kit testing backlog. In addition to the $5 million Cohen secured last year, the overall funding level is now up to $45 million, a 25% increase over the last two years.
“When evidence is sitting on a shelf somewhere waiting to be tested, that means assailants are still at large and could be assaulting more victims. The backlog of untested rape kits across this country is shameful, and we need to commit the resources necessary to get them tested,” Congressman Cohen said.
The House and Senate are expected to vote on the 2016 Omnibus Fiscal Year 2016 Spending Bill later this week.

I would like to thank the voters of Tennessee’s 9 th District for electing me to a 5 th term in the United States House of Representatives. It has been my privilege to serve you both here and in Washington, D.C. and I look forward to continuing the fight to bring jobs, funds, and opportunity back to the 9 th District, reform our nation’s drug laws and sentencing laws, restore voting rights, protect civil rights, and pass the infrastructure bill that America’s Distribution Center needs.
Those of you who were unable to join us at The Warehouse last night missed a wonderful Victory Party. It’s okay though- We will have another two years from now! Thank you Kris Kourdouvelis for allowing us to use the space and thank you to Double J Smokehouse & Saloon for the delicious barbecue. Ghost River provided us with some delicious, locally produced beer and Chris Gales did a magnificent job keeping the crowd entertained.
I was honored to be joined by Memphis City Councilman Myron Lowery, new State Senator Lee Harris, Shelby County Commissioners Reginald Milton, Willie Brooks, and Van Turner, former Shelby County Commissioner Steve Mulroy , State Representative Larry Miller, former Memphis City School Board member Dr. Jeff Warren, and Assessor of Property Cheyenne Johnson. They are all principled public officials and I’m proud to have helped them all at some point through the years.
Obviously, not every outcome last night was to my liking. Amendment 1 passed despite the valiant local efforts of some very good friends and despite the best efforts of Shelby County’s voters, who rejected it 63-37. I am proud that Shelby County voted so overwhelmingly to allow women to make their own medical decisions without interference from Nashville politicians.
Now that the campaign is over, the true battle begins.
Thank you 9 th District and thank you Shelby County.

Team Cohen 2 Steve Cohen Wins 5th Term in Congress! Posted November 6, 2014 · Add Comment I would like to thank the voters of Tennessee’s 9 th District for electing me to a 5 th term in the United States House of Representatives. It has been my privilege to serve you both here and in Washington, D.C. and I look forward to continuing the fight to bring jobs, funds, and opportunity back to the 9 th District, reform our nation’s drug laws and sentencing laws, restore voting rights, protect civil rights, and pass the infrastructure bill that America’s Distribution Center needs. Those of you who were unable to join us at The Warehouse last night missed a wonderful Victory Party. It’s okay though- We will have another two years from now! Thank you Kris Kourdouvelis for allowing us to use the space and thank you to Double J Smokehouse & Saloon for the delicious barbecue. Ghost River provided us with some delicious, locally produced beer and Chris Gales did a magnificent job keeping the crowd entertained. I was honored to be joined by Memphis City Councilman Myron Lowery, new State Senator Lee Harris, Shelby County Commissioners Reginald Milton, Willie Brooks, and Van Turner, former Shelby County Commissioner Steve Mulroy , State Representative Larry Miller, former Memphis City School Board member Dr. Jeff Warren, and Assessor of Property Cheyenne Johnson. They are all principled public officials and I’m proud to have helped them all at some point through the years. Obviously, not every outcome last night was to my liking. Amendment 1 passed despite the valiant local efforts of some very good friends and despite the best efforts of Shelby County’s voters, who rejected it 63-37. I am proud that Shelby County voted so overwhelmingly to allow women to make their own medical decisions without interference from Nashville politicians. Now that the campaign is over, the true battle begins. Thank you 9 th District and thank you Shelby County.
