Website: Marjorie Taylor Greene GA House

While the communist Democrat Party wields ever-more terrifying authoritarian power over the people of America, Marjorie Taylor Greene is leading the resistance. She is the woman in Washington holding Republicans accountable, insisting that they mount credible and effective defenses. Marjorie holds her colleagues to the America First promises they make on TV. She believes in common sense, in putting Americans first, and in a Republican Party that faithfully represents workers, traditional families, and rural America.
“She doesn't back down. She doesn't give up. And she's always been with Trump. Marjorie has worked very hard to secure the border, stop the Radical Left, and ensure the truth is known about the 2020 Presidential Election. She loves our country and MAGA, It's the greatest ever political movement. Marjorie is running for re-election to Congress, and has my complete and total endorsement!"

Marjorie Taylor Greene was born and raised in the great state of Georgia. Marjorie graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. MTG has a lifetime of business experience, having grown up working in her family’s company. The company, Taylor Construction, has managed a quarter of a billion dollars of construction projects. Marjorie has always had a strong work ethic, tenacity, perseverance, and dedication. MTG also successfully started, grew, and sold a thriving CrossFit gym in Georgia, becoming one of the top CrossFit gyms in the country. Marjorie’s competitive nature is legendary. From years of training in CrossFit, she finished 47th in a worldwide competition that brings the best in sport. CrossFit is important in Marjorie’s life because she has learned as a competitor never to give up and relentlessly pursue to fight for her beliefs. As a result, MTG has a unique perspective on how to succeed from the ground up through actual hard work and financial responsibility.
MTG believes the best part of her life is being a mother and spending time with her family. Marjorie has three children and counts the time she spent as a mother as the foundation of her life. MTG loves being a mother to her children whom God has entrusted in her care, and every step she has taken has been to lead and protect her family. Marjorie has been actively involved in her community and in her children’s schools. MTG has a strong Christian faith and believes we must continue to protect our great freedoms and work to keep America a great country. Marjorie believes America’s future is America First.
Marjorie’s experiences as a mother and an entrepreneur have served to fuel her determination to work for the American people in Congress because she has lived the American dream. Providing the best home for our children is a top priority as a mother. She believes we must provide safe and secure land of opportunities so our children can succeed in the future. MTG is determined to help others achieve, grow, and to thrive. Marjorie Taylor Greene made a difference in her community long before she ran for Congress. MTG wants to make a difference to each American to light the pathway to success and to assure that this country remains free for all of us. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a force to be reckoned with and accustomed to battles.  She will not stop fighting for the people of the state of Georgia and for all Americans to ensure that our country remains free and a beacon of light and justice for the entire world.
Although our problems are numerous and undeniably grave, we can triumph over them. We can defeat the evil forces committed to our destruction. America’s potential is too great for us to simply give up, no matter how powerful the enemy may seem. All that is necessary to secure our American revival is for Washington to represent the wishes and priorities of the people it purports to serve again.
MTG is one of the world’s most scrutinized and reported-on public figures. Marjorie Taylor Greene will not back down. She voted NO against the radical Democrat agenda, put Congress on record by forcing roll call votes, made procedural moves on the floor to stop bills, and introduced America First legislation for all to support. Securing our border, addressing abuse by federal agencies, and representing the values of Northwest Georgia is among her top priorities for her sophomore term in Congress. MTG is determined to stand up for what is right. Left-wing radicals have spent two years turning this great nation into a disaster. The threats to our country include a failing economy, rising food, and gas prices, threats to our national security from every direction, an open border, and a weak President with an even more inadequate executive staff who seem only to function to support Ukraine and China more than American citizens. We are under threats that no one imagined just three short years ago. The time is now, and Marjorie Taylor Greene will continue to hold every person in Washington, DC, accountable by bringing to light the inadequacies and corruption that have become the norm. Join MTG in this fight because doing otherwise will undoubtedly endanger the future of each of us and for our children. We must Save America and Stop Communism.

Stand with Marjorie Taylor Greene! TO SAVE AMERICA, STOP COMMUNISM!
Marjorie Taylor Greene, better known as MTG, is a businesswoman, a mother, a Christian, and the Member of Congress for Georgia’s 14th Congressional district. Marjorie is one of the highest-profile politicians in the world, beloved by patriots and relentlessly slandered by Democrats and the media. MTG is a ferocious supporter and ally of President Donald J. Trump and one of America’s leading populist voices, tirelessly campaigning for American values, patriotism, capitalism, and the rights of the unborn. She was banned from Twitter for her fearless advocacy and uniquely effective presence in Congress. Yet, Marjorie Taylor Greene will not back down. There has never been a time more appropriate for Americans to stand up for this country.
“I was compelled to enter politics not out of self-interest but because I believe our challenges are not insurmountable. America’s potential is too great for us to give up, no matter how powerful the enemy may seem.”

The FBI has created a dual system of justice in America: one for Republicans and one for Democrats.
During just the past few years, the FBI spied on, lied about, and raided the home(s) of President Trump, his lawyers, and previous administration officials; labeled parents as domestic terrorists for standing up to the radical Left’s Critical Race Theory agenda; hunted down Americans just for being on Capitol grounds on J6, but ignored the domestic terrorism that occurred during the 2020 summer of love.
This dual system of justice, politicization, and weaponization of the world’s most powerful law enforcement agency must end now. Marjorie believes that the FBI has lost all credibility and appearance of impropriety in upholding and enforcing the laws of the United States. MTG supports using the power of the purse to hold the FBI accountable until dramatic reforms and changes are made to restore the American people’s trust.
Joe Biden violated his oath of office the day he began occupying the White House.
He shut down the Keystone pipeline on his first day in office; abandoned Americans in Afghanistan; sold America’s strategic petroleum reserves to China; facilitated the invasion at our Southern Border; and is compromised by our foreign adversaries like China through business deals made by his family.
The Democrats impeached President Trump for exposing Biden’s corruption in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Biden lied to the American people and colluded with the fake news media and Big Tech to cover it up. Marjorie is devoted to building the case for the impeachment of Joe Biden and will work every day to build consensus within the Republican majority to support her efforts.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the chief architect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Fauci had one goal regarding the origin of the Chinese bioweapon, COVID-19: disprove the lab-leak theory. However, it was not to investigate the Wuhan Institute of Virology; it was not to investigate China and the Communist Party, and it was not to serve, protect, and be transparent with the American people. Instead, Fauci led the charge in helping cover up the most significant crime in world history.
From 2014-2019, Fauci awarded grants to organizations conducting gain-of-function experiments involving coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. According to Biden’s own government, this Chinese lab is responsible for releasing the COVID-19 bioweapon. Fauci thinks he can run and hide by retiring, but he cannot hide from Marjorie Taylor Greene.
As a member of the COVID-19 Select Subcommittee, MTG will further expose Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic; investigate why so many young Americans are dying suddenly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine; hold bureaucrats within the CDC, FDA, the Biden Administration, and the executives in Big Pharma accountable for lying about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine; and hold Big Tech responsible for colluding with the federal government to censor and silence the voices of millions of Americans.
America’s children are under assault from the forces of evil and their Marxist agenda.
Decades in the making, the Marxists have never had more influence over the cultural and societal institutions traditionally relied upon to shape our children’s minds. They teach them anti-American Critical Race Theory curriculum in the classroom and facilitate the sexualization of our children with pornographic reading materials; groom them with the cult of transgenderism and Drag Queen Storytime; and advocate for gender-affirming care, leaving them permanently mutilated and scarred for life.
Marjorie is dedicated to eliminating this Marxist ideology preying on our children. She has no tolerance for manipulating or mutating the most vulnerable and innocent members of our society. MTG will never stop fighting to protect our children from these forces of evil.
Marjorie believes all lives matter. Every life is precious – period.
MTG strongly agrees that life begins at inception; adamantly supports the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion up to individual states; has an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life Action for supporting the unborn; and has received a 100% score from the National Right to Life.
Unborn children should not be condemned to a painful death for being “inconvenient.” Marjorie will fight to end abortion-on-demand and stop taxpayer funding of abortion.
Biden is watering down the Second Amendment with executive decrees and regulations. Marjorie has one message for Biden and the Democrats attempting to disarm the American people: come and take it.
MTG strongly defends our God-given right to bear arms; has an A rating from the NRA; supports eliminating the ATF; opposes Red Flag confiscation; believes in ending Gun Free Zones and empowering law enforcement; and advocates for the hardening of our schools against violent sociopaths.
Marjorie is devoted to ensuring every American has the right to self-defense and supports open carry laws throughout her district and nation.
For decades, the Washington establishment ignored the average American in pursuit of implementing its globalist agenda.
This all changed when President Trump was sworn into office on January 20 th , 2017. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no longer. President Trump’s America First Agenda inspired Marjorie to run for Congress. She could no longer sit on the sidelines and realized the future of her children and America depended on more Patriots running and serving in public office.
Marjorie is now one of the most popular conservative firebrands in America. A champion of the America First Agenda, MTG represents the voice of millions of Americans despised by the Washington establishment; never backs down to the fake news media and the radical Left’s agenda; and is unapologetically devoted to defeating the globalist agenda that is destroying America’s liberty, freedom, and sovereignty.
America was founded on Judeo-Christian values and principles.
The radical Left has declared war on Christians, gender, families, and traditional American values. They relentlessly pursue, target, cancel, and harass anyone that refuses to bow down to their demands and conform to their evil ideology.
Marjorie believes the key to American greatness is restoring traditional American values in our culture and society. MTG is devoted to her faith in God; a champion for religious freedom; rejects the Left’s unscientific fantasies that there are more than two genders; and has received a 100% score from the Family Research Council for defending traditional American family values.
A country without borders is not a nation.
Biden and the Democrats have left our Southern Border open like Swiss cheese; they advocate for the defunding of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; refuse to enforce our immigration laws; tied the hands of the United States Border Patrol; supported the repeal of Title 42; empower the drug cartels; ignore human trafficking and forced child labor; and have allowed the free flow of Chinese-made, Mexican Cartel imported fentanyl to poison America’s youth and the vulnerable.
Marjorie believes it is time for Congress to prioritize America’s border over Ukraine’s. MTG supports finishing the wall on our Southern Border; abolishing sanctuary cities at the federal level; deporting illegal aliens jailed in federal and state prisons across America; and declaring war on the cartels engaged in human trafficking and the deadly poisoning of millions of Americans with fentanyl

President Trump’s America First Agenda inspired Marjorie to run for Congress. She could no longer sit on the sidelines and realized the future of her children and America depended on more Patriots running and serving in public office.
Marjorie is now one of the most popular conservative firebrands in America. A champion of the America First Agenda, MTG represents the voice of millions of Americans despised by the Washington establishment; never backs down to the fake news media and the radical Left’s agenda; and is unapologetically devoted to defeating the globalist agenda that is destroying America’s liberty, freedom, and sovereignty.
America was founded on Judeo-Christian values and principles.
The radical Left has declared war on Christians, gender, families, and traditional American values. They relentlessly pursue, target, cancel, and harass anyone that refuses to bow down to their demands and conform to their evil ideology.
Marjorie believes the key to American greatness is restoring traditional American values in our culture and society. MTG is devoted to her faith in God; a champion for religious freedom; rejects the Left’s unscientific fantasies that there are more than two genders; and has received a 100% score from the Family Research Council for defending traditional American family values.
A country without borders is not a nation.
Biden and the Democrats have left our Southern Border open like Swiss cheese; they advocate for the defunding of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; refuse to enforce our immigration laws; tied the hands of the United States Border Patrol; supported the repeal of Title 42; empower the drug cartels; ignore human trafficking and forced child labor; and have allowed the free flow of Chinese-made, Mexican Cartel imported fentanyl to poison America’s youth and the vulnerable.
Marjorie believes it is time for Congress to prioritize America’s border over Ukraine’s. MTG supports finishing the wall on our Southern Border; abolishing sanctuary cities at the federal level; deporting illegal aliens jailed in federal and state prisons across America; and declaring war on the cartels engaged in human trafficking and the deadly poisoning of millions of Americans with fentanyl

The FBI has created a dual system of justice in America: one for Republicans and one for Democrats.
During just the past few years, the FBI spied on, lied about, and raided the home(s) of President Trump, his lawyers, and previous administration officials; labeled parents as domestic terrorists for standing up to the radical Left’s Critical Race Theory agenda; hunted down Americans just for being on Capitol grounds on J6, but ignored the domestic terrorism that occurred during the 2020 summer of love.
This dual system of justice, politicization, and weaponization of the world’s most powerful law enforcement agency must end now. Marjorie believes that the FBI has lost all credibility and appearance of impropriety in upholding and enforcing the laws of the United States. MTG supports using the power of the purse to hold the FBI accountable until dramatic reforms and changes are made to restore the American people’s trust.
Joe Biden violated his oath of office the day he began occupying the White House.
He shut down the Keystone pipeline on his first day in office; abandoned Americans in Afghanistan; sold America’s strategic petroleum reserves to China; facilitated the invasion at our Southern Border; and is compromised by our foreign adversaries like China through business deals made by his family.
The Democrats impeached President Trump for exposing Biden’s corruption in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Biden lied to the American people and colluded with the fake news media and Big Tech to cover it up. Marjorie is devoted to building the case for the impeachment of Joe Biden and will work every day to build consensus within the Republican majority to support her efforts.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the chief architect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Fauci had one goal regarding the origin of the Chinese bioweapon, COVID-19: disprove the lab-leak theory. However, it was not to investigate the Wuhan Institute of Virology; it was not to investigate China and the Communist Party, and it was not to serve, protect, and be transparent with the American people. Instead, Fauci led the charge in helping cover up the most significant crime in world history.
From 2014-2019, Fauci awarded grants to organizations conducting gain-of-function experiments involving coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. According to Biden’s own government, this Chinese lab is responsible for releasing the COVID-19 bioweapon. Fauci thinks he can run and hide by retiring, but he cannot hide from Marjorie Taylor Greene.
As a member of the COVID-19 Select Subcommittee, MTG will further expose Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic; investigate why so many young Americans are dying suddenly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine; hold bureaucrats within the CDC, FDA, the Biden Administration, and the executives in Big Pharma accountable for lying about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine; and hold Big Tech responsible for colluding with the federal government to censor and silence the voices of millions of Americans.
America’s children are under assault from the forces of evil and their Marxist agenda.
Decades in the making, the Marxists have never had more influence over the cultural and societal institutions traditionally relied upon to shape our children’s minds. They teach them anti-American Critical Race Theory curriculum in the classroom and facilitate the sexualization of our children with pornographic reading materials; groom them with the cult of transgenderism and Drag Queen Storytime; and advocate for gender-affirming care, leaving them permanently mutilated and scarred for life.
Marjorie is dedicated to eliminating this Marxist ideology preying on our children. She has no tolerance for manipulating or mutating the most vulnerable and innocent members of our society. MTG will never stop fighting to protect our children from these forces of evil.
Marjorie believes all lives matter. Every life is precious – period.
MTG strongly agrees that life begins at inception; adamantly supports the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion up to individual states; has an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life Action for supporting the unborn; and has received a 100% score from the National Right to Life.
Unborn children should not be condemned to a painful death for being “inconvenient.” Marjorie will fight to end abortion-on-demand and stop taxpayer funding of abortion.
Biden is watering down the Second Amendment with executive decrees and regulations. Marjorie has one message for Biden and the Democrats attempting to disarm the American people: come and take it.
MTG strongly defends our God-given right to bear arms; has an A rating from the NRA; supports eliminating the ATF; opposes Red Flag confiscation; believes in ending Gun Free Zones and empowering law enforcement; and advocates for the hardening of our schools against violent sociopaths.
Marjorie is devoted to ensuring every American has the right to self-defense and supports open carry laws throughout her district and nation.

MTG strongly defends our God-given right to bear arms; has an A rating from the NRA; supports eliminating the ATF; opposes Red Flag confiscation; believes in ending Gun Free Zones and empowering law enforcement; and advocates for the hardening of our schools against violent sociopaths.
Marjorie is devoted to ensuring every American has the right to self-defense and supports open carry laws throughout her district and nation.
For decades, the Washington establishment ignored the average American in pursuit of implementing its globalist agenda.
This all changed when President Trump was sworn into office on January 20 th , 2017. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no longer. President Trump’s America First Agenda inspired Marjorie to run for Congress. She could no longer sit on the sidelines and realized the future of her children and America depended on more Patriots running and serving in public office.
Marjorie is now one of the most popular conservative firebrands in America. A champion of the America First Agenda, MTG represents the voice of millions of Americans despised by the Washington establishment; never backs down to the fake news media and the radical Left’s agenda; and is unapologetically devoted to defeating the globalist agenda that is destroying America’s liberty, freedom, and sovereignty.
America was founded on Judeo-Christian values and principles.
The radical Left has declared war on Christians, gender, families, and traditional American values. They relentlessly pursue, target, cancel, and harass anyone that refuses to bow down to their demands and conform to their evil ideology.
Marjorie believes the key to American greatness is restoring traditional American values in our culture and society. MTG is devoted to her faith in God; a champion for religious freedom; rejects the Left’s unscientific fantasies that there are more than two genders; and has received a 100% score from the Family Research Council for defending traditional American family values.
A country without borders is not a nation.
Biden and the Democrats have left our Southern Border open like Swiss cheese; they advocate for the defunding of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; refuse to enforce our immigration laws; tied the hands of the United States Border Patrol; supported the repeal of Title 42; empower the drug cartels; ignore human trafficking and forced child labor; and have allowed the free flow of Chinese-made, Mexican Cartel imported fentanyl to poison America’s youth and the vulnerable.
Marjorie believes it is time for Congress to prioritize America’s border over Ukraine’s. MTG supports finishing the wall on our Southern Border; abolishing sanctuary cities at the federal level; deporting illegal aliens jailed in federal and state prisons across America; and declaring war on the cartels engaged in human trafficking and the deadly poisoning of millions of Americans with fentanyl

The FBI has created a dual system of justice in America: one for Republicans and one for Democrats.
During just the past few years, the FBI spied on, lied about, and raided the home(s) of President Trump, his lawyers, and previous administration officials; labeled parents as domestic terrorists for standing up to the radical Left’s Critical Race Theory agenda; hunted down Americans just for being on Capitol grounds on J6, but ignored the domestic terrorism that occurred during the 2020 summer of love.
This dual system of justice, politicization, and weaponization of the world’s most powerful law enforcement agency must end now. Marjorie believes that the FBI has lost all credibility and appearance of impropriety in upholding and enforcing the laws of the United States. MTG supports using the power of the purse to hold the FBI accountable until dramatic reforms and changes are made to restore the American people’s trust.
Joe Biden violated his oath of office the day he began occupying the White House.
He shut down the Keystone pipeline on his first day in office; abandoned Americans in Afghanistan; sold America’s strategic petroleum reserves to China; facilitated the invasion at our Southern Border; and is compromised by our foreign adversaries like China through business deals made by his family.
The Democrats impeached President Trump for exposing Biden’s corruption in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Biden lied to the American people and colluded with the fake news media and Big Tech to cover it up. Marjorie is devoted to building the case for the impeachment of Joe Biden and will work every day to build consensus within the Republican majority to support her efforts.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the chief architect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Fauci had one goal regarding the origin of the Chinese bioweapon, COVID-19: disprove the lab-leak theory. However, it was not to investigate the Wuhan Institute of Virology; it was not to investigate China and the Communist Party, and it was not to serve, protect, and be transparent with the American people. Instead, Fauci led the charge in helping cover up the most significant crime in world history.
From 2014-2019, Fauci awarded grants to organizations conducting gain-of-function experiments involving coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. According to Biden’s own government, this Chinese lab is responsible for releasing the COVID-19 bioweapon. Fauci thinks he can run and hide by retiring, but he cannot hide from Marjorie Taylor Greene.
As a member of the COVID-19 Select Subcommittee, MTG will further expose Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic; investigate why so many young Americans are dying suddenly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine; hold bureaucrats within the CDC, FDA, the Biden Administration, and the executives in Big Pharma accountable for lying about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine; and hold Big Tech responsible for colluding with the federal government to censor and silence the voices of millions of Americans.
America’s children are under assault from the forces of evil and their Marxist agenda.
Decades in the making, the Marxists have never had more influence over the cultural and societal institutions traditionally relied upon to shape our children’s minds. They teach them anti-American Critical Race Theory curriculum in the classroom and facilitate the sexualization of our children with pornographic reading materials; groom them with the cult of transgenderism and Drag Queen Storytime; and advocate for gender-affirming care, leaving them permanently mutilated and scarred for life.
Marjorie is dedicated to eliminating this Marxist ideology preying on our children. She has no tolerance for manipulating or mutating the most vulnerable and innocent members of our society. MTG will never stop fighting to protect our children from these forces of evil.
Marjorie believes all lives matter. Every life is precious – period.
MTG strongly agrees that life begins at inception; adamantly supports the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion up to individual states; has an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life Action for supporting the unborn; and has received a 100% score from the National Right to Life.
Unborn children should not be condemned to a painful death for being “inconvenient.” Marjorie will fight to end abortion-on-demand and stop taxpayer funding of abortion.
