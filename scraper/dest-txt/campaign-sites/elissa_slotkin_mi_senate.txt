Elissa’s story is one of hard work, community, and service. Those are the values she learned growing up in Michigan, and they’re the values that she’ll bring to the U.S. Senate.
A third generation Michigander, Elissa was shaped by her early life on her family farm in Holly, Michigan. Elissa has dedicated her life to serving our country and protecting our homeland – first in the CIA, where she served three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military, and later at the White House, State Department, and finally at the Pentagon.
Her family story is “made in Michigan,” starting with her great-grandfather. He came to the United States and lived the American Dream when he founded the family meat business, Hygrade Foods. The company created a number of food staples beloved by Michiganders, including the famous Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium.

Elissa is a third-generation Michigander whose early life was shaped by the time she spent on her family farm in Holly, Michigan. Her family story is one of hard work and sacrifice, starting with her great-grandfather. He immigrated to the U.S. and achieved his American Dream by founding the family meat business, Hygrade Foods, which established its headquarters in Detroit in 1949. Hygrade created a number of food staples beloved by Michiganders, including the famous Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium. The values of hard work, decency, and integrity that underpinned his success were passed down from generation to generation, ultimately guiding Elissa into a life of service.
Elissa has dedicated her career to serving the country she loves. She happened to be in New York City on September 11, 2001, and by the time the dust cleared, Elissa knew she wanted to go into national security to protect our homeland. She was recruited by the CIA to be a Middle East analyst, and within a year she was sent on the first of three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military.
Her time in a combat zone led her to national security roles at the White House, where she worked as a civil servant, for whoever was the Commander-in-Chief. Elissa worked for President Bush as a member of his national security staff and was asked to stay on when President Obama took office. In the Obama Administration, she helped negotiate some of the Pentagon’s most sensitive national security matters from the fight against ISIS to the U.S. response to Russian aggression. No matter the issue, the values Elissa learned growing up in Michigan – a straightforward, common-sense approach – were what helped her succeed as a national security leader.
But the reason she first decided to run for office was more personal: her mom. Elissa’s mother died of ovarian cancer in 2011. She struggled to afford healthcare for years because of an early case of breast cancer, and at the time, the insurance companies had gouged her for years based on that pre-existing condition. The same month that the family got her mother’s terminal diagnosis and was desperately trying to get her life-saving care was the same month that they were also filling out the paperwork for her to declare bankruptcy. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the exorbitant cost of healthcare and prescription drugs got Elissa into politics, and it remains one of her top priorities.
Elissa has spent her time in Congress working on the issues that she hears about most from people across Michigan: bringing down the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, bringing critical supply chains back to the U.S., creating jobs with dignity, and getting money out of politics. Now, she’s ready to fight for all of Michigan’s working families in the U.S. Senate.

Elissa believes that our government works best when we have two healthy parties that debate the big issues facing Americans. She has always tried to work across the aisle on issues like bringing critical supply chains back home, but she always stood her ground when it comes to issues of principle, like protecting our rights and our democracy.
Elissa’s priorities will grow and deepen as she embarks on a listening tour around Michigan, visiting communities across the state to learn about how she can best serve in the U.S. Senate.

Elissa believes that protecting America’s democracy is the ultimate kitchen table issue – because every other issue depends on a vibrant and resilient democracy. Elissa has made defending and expanding voting rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and women’s rights a priority in her time in public office.
In order to preserve our democracy, we must also reform the very political system we use to elect our leaders. With trust in our elected officials at an all-time low and with the foundation of our democracy at stake, Elissa is proud to have never taken a dime of corporate PAC money – not ever. In Congress, she has led the charge to ban corporate PACs and pushed leaders in both parties to ban Members of Congress from trading stocks. Elissa believes our government needs to work for the people — not the wealthy and the well-connected.
Click here to hear Elissa talk about protecting our children from the things that are truly harming them >>
Elissa’s national security background means she’s focused on the things that are truly a threat to our kids. From physical safety to cybersecurity, she feels there is no higher responsibility than to protect the next generation.
Elissa is the first Member of Congress to have two school shootings in her district – the first in Oxford and the second at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Elissa has seen firsthand the toll gun violence has taken on Michigan and our children. In Congress, Elissa has supported no-brainer gun safety measures to keep our communities safe, including safe storage of firearms, universal background checks, red flag laws, and the assault weapons ban.
After the November 2021 shooting at Oxford High School, Elissa introduced a bill requiring safe storage of firearms when children are present in the home, which passed in the House in 2022. Having grown up in a gun-owning family and being trained on a Glock and an M4 during three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military, Elissa respects the right to own and to use it responsibly for hunting and sportsmanship – but she will never stop fighting to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.

Elissa believes that we need to make more critical items in America, so that we are in control of our own economic security.
She pushed leaders in both parties to pass the CHIPS Act into law to manufacture microchips in the U.S. and protect Michigan’s auto industry. And she championed bills like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to rebuild our roads, bridges, and water infrastructure while creating tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs across Michigan. In the Senate, Elissa will work every day to bring critical supply chains and manufacturing back home.
Click here to hear Elissa talk about the importance of protecting and expanding our middle class >>
Elissa is a big believer in protecting and expanding Michigan’s middle class. That means addressing the things Michiganders talk about every night at the kitchen table: their pocketbooks and their kids.
Elissa has fought to create jobs with dignity in Michigan, taken on the Chinese government, and worked to bring critical supply chains back to America and good-paying jobs back to Michigan.
And like many Americans, healthcare is a deeply personal issue for Elissa. In fact, it was the reason she decided to first run for office. In 2009, Elissa’s mother was diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer at a time when she was uninsured. She struggled to afford healthcare for years because of an early case of breast cancer, and at the time, the insurance companies had gouged her for years based on that pre-existing condition. The same month that Elissa got her mother’s terminal diagnosis and was desperately trying to get her life-saving care was the same month that the family was also filling out the paperwork for her to declare bankruptcy.
Elissa believes all Americans should have access to healthcare they can afford, regardless of pre-existing conditions. No one should ever go broke because they happen to get sick, and no family should have to decide whether they can afford to save the life of a loved one. In Congress, Elissa has taken the fight to Big Pharma and helped pass legislation to make prescription drug prices more transparent that is coming into force in early 2023, and fought to pass laws that capped the cost of insulin for seniors, and allowed Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices.

Working with community leaders, Elissa secured over $55 million in direct federal dollars to fund important community projects on issues like gun violence prevention, safe and transparent policing, affordable and accessible childcare, and community health. Projects include:
Support inclusive community and economic development that prioritizes a true investment in workforce development and training for jobs of today, and the future.
Provide Title I resources to neighborhood schools and attract and retain quality childcare workers and educators from the communities they serve.
Expand early childhood development programs that are proven to work – including Head Start, the expanded Child Tax Credit and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to support parents and families.
Ensure federal dollars are spent equitably and reflect the real needs of our cities and towns – so Michiganders can see and feel the investment coming to their communities.
Ensure fair and transparent policing by increasing funding for initiatives for urban communities.
Reduce health disparities by increasing access to quality healthcare and nutritious food, and going after the long-standing problems like infant mortality and Black maternal health.
Increase access to capital and other financial tools to support minority businesses, and increase transparency and accountability for lenders.
Ensure minority businesses have equal access to federal contracts and enforce oversight policies–so businesses can create sustainable futures.
Reform the filibuster , which is critical to give issues like voting rights an up-or-down vote in the U.S. Senate.
Secure funds to revitalize Michigan’s housing stock so everyone is on the path to homeownership.
Enact responsible gun laws and expand opportunities for youth , to keep our communities, schools, and places of worship safe.

Click here to hear Elissa talk about the importance of protecting and expanding our middle class >>
Elissa is a big believer in protecting and expanding Michigan’s middle class. That means addressing the things Michiganders talk about every night at the kitchen table: their pocketbooks and their kids.
Elissa has fought to create jobs with dignity in Michigan, taken on the Chinese government, and worked to bring critical supply chains back to America and good-paying jobs back to Michigan.
And like many Americans, healthcare is a deeply personal issue for Elissa. In fact, it was the reason she decided to first run for office. In 2009, Elissa’s mother was diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer at a time when she was uninsured. She struggled to afford healthcare for years because of an early case of breast cancer, and at the time, the insurance companies had gouged her for years based on that pre-existing condition. The same month that Elissa got her mother’s terminal diagnosis and was desperately trying to get her life-saving care was the same month that the family was also filling out the paperwork for her to declare bankruptcy.
Elissa believes all Americans should have access to healthcare they can afford, regardless of pre-existing conditions. No one should ever go broke because they happen to get sick, and no family should have to decide whether they can afford to save the life of a loved one. In Congress, Elissa has taken the fight to Big Pharma and helped pass legislation to make prescription drug prices more transparent that is coming into force in early 2023, and fought to pass laws that capped the cost of insulin for seniors, and allowed Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices.
