Music ( 00:02 ):
…. now.
( 00:02 ) We've got the groove.
( 00:02 ) Ain't no stoppin' us now.
( 00:06 ) We're on the move.
( 00:07 ) Ain't no stoppin' us now.
( 00:07 ) We've got the groove.
( 00:07 ) There's been so many things-
Curtis Hertel ( 00:30 ):
Hello, East Lansing. How are you? Are you fired up? My name is Curtis Hertel. I was proud to represent Mid-Michigan as a state senator. I'm a proud MSU alum and even prouder Spartan dad. And I'm proud to be the Democratic nominee for Congress in this district. Being on campus, I am reminded of how change happens and the power of students. It was students that led the fight to change gun safety laws here in Michigan. It was students who led the charge to get rid of the state's 1931 abortion law. And it was students who organized and passed Prop Three and enshrined abortion rights in the Michigan Constitution. But we all have more work to do. We are in the district that will decide the control of the House of Representatives, in the state that'll decide control of the Senate, and the state that will decide the presidency. No pressure.
( 02:17 ) And in two days time, you better believe it will be students here on campus who will propel us the victory up and down the ballot. We need you to vote like your future depends on it, because quite simply, it does. Spartans will decide for the future where the decision to start your family is. Is it our choice or is it Donald Trump's choice? Or is it my opponent, Tom Barrett's choice? Spartans will vote for a future free from gun violence. Spartans will vote for a future where you can be who you are and love who you love.
( 03:27 ) Spartans will vote for a future where it's more affordable to live the American dream, to buy a home, to raise a family here in America. And Spartans will vote for a future where Vice President Harris becomes President Harris. This future only happens if we vote, but voting is not enough. Bring your friends to the polls. Bring your roommates. Call your grandma. I'm sure she'd like to hear from you. Because participating in our democracy is patriotic. Doing the work to build a better future is patriotic. I'm so proud to be a Spartan and to see so many Spartans ready to vote here on campus in East Lansing. Go green. Go vote. Let's go win.
Music ( 04:56 ):

( 10:10 ) Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause.
( 10:13 ) Getting measures on the tip of the vibers.
( 10:15 ) Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz.
( 10:18 ) Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug.
( 10:20 ) If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug.
( 10:23 ) Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug.
( 10:25 ) Afrocentric living is a big shrug.
( 10:28 ) A life filled with fun, that's what I love.
( 10:30 ) A lower plateau is what we're above.
( 10:33 ) If you diss us, we won't even think of.
( 10:35 ) Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?

( 11:57 ) Right now, Phife is a poem sayer. At times, I'm a studio conveyor.
( 12:02 ) Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
( 12:05 ) You'll be doing us a really big favor.

( 14:42 ) So polite, we're busy still saying please.
( 14:42 ) Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend.
( 14:42 ) Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz.
( 14:42 ) First we run, and then we laugh 'til we cry.
( 14:42 ) But when the night is falling.
( 14:42 ) You cannot find the light.
( 14:42 ) Light.

( 14:42 ) But hey, we do it in style.
( 14:42 ) The bad rich.
( 14:42 ) God's flying in for your trial.
( 14:42 ) But when the night is falling.
( 14:42 ) You cannot find a friend.
( 14:42 ) Friend.
( 14:42 ) You feel your tree is breaking.
( 14:42 ) Just bend.

( 18:24 ) You know that I caught it.
( 18:27 ) Bad, bad boy.
( 18:28 ) Shiny toy with a price. You know that I bought it.
( 18:36 ) Killing me slow, out the window.
( 18:36 ) I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below.
( 18:36 ) Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes.
( 18:40 ) What doesn't kill me makes me want you more.
( 18:42 ) And it's new, the shape of your body.
( 18:43 ) It's blue, the feeling I've got.
( 18:43 ) And it's ooh, whoa, oh.
( 18:43 ) It's a cruel summer.
( 18:43 ) It's cool, that's what I tell 'em.
( 19:06 ) No rules in breakable heaven.
( 19:07 ) But ooh, whoa, oh.
( 19:10 ) It's a cruel summer.
( 19:10 ) With you.
( 19:10 ) Hang your head low.
( 19:11 ) In the glow of the vending machine.
( 19:12 ) I'm not dying.
( 19:14 ) You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times.
( 19:18 ) We're not trying.
( 19:19 ) So cut the headlights, summer's a knife.
( 19:23 ) I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone.
( 19:26 ) Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes.
( 19:37 ) And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know.
( 19:37 ) Oh, it's new, the shape of your body.
( 19:37 ) It's blue, the feeling I've got.
( 19:37 ) And it's ooh, whoa, oh.
( 19:37 ) It's a cruel summer.
( 19:38 ) It's cool, that's what I tell 'em.
( 19:48 ) No rules in breakable heaven. But ooh, whoa, oh.
( 20:01 ) It's a cruel summer.
( 20:01 ) With you.
( 20:01 ) I'm drunk in the back of the car.
( 20:01 ) And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar.
( 20:01 ) Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true.
( 20:02 ) I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you.
( 20:02 ) And I snuck in through the garden gate.
( 20:02 ) Every night that summer just to seal my fate.
( 20:02 ) And I screamed for whatever it's worth.
( 20:02 ) "I love you," ain't that the worst thing you ever heard-
Speaker 1 ( 20:15 ):
Please welcome Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist.
Music ( 20:18 ):
Now if you feel that you can't go on.
( 20:18 ) Can't go on.
( 20:18 ) Because all of your hope is gone.
( 20:18 ) All your hope is gone.
( 20:18 ) And your life is filled with much confusion.
( 20:18 ) Much confusion.
( 20:18 ) Until…
Garlin Gilchrist ( 20:50 ):
What's up, MSU? So I am so proud to stand here with you because this university will make sure that Kamala Harris becomes the next president. I want to try a little something. Everybody knows that MSU stands for Michigan State University. But I think that for the next two days, MSU should mean Michigan stand up. So I thought we'd try a new little chant just to give us some energy before we hear from our next president. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up Michigan stand up.
Crowd ( 21:52 ):
Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up.
Garlin Gilchrist ( 21:58 ):
That sounds pretty good, right? We are standing up for our values. We are standing up for reproductive freedom. We are standing up for freedom against gun violence. We are standing up for our economic freedom. We are standing up for our freedom to vote. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are fighting for every last one of those freedoms every single day. And you know who else is fighting for those freedoms? Your next United States Senator, Elissa Slotkin. In Michigan, me and perhaps she's soon to be the most famous Michigan State alum, you might've heard of her, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, we have shown not just Michiganders, but the nation, that democratic governance is worth voting for. And we're going to keep the Democratic trifecta because we're going to send Kyra Harris Bolden and Kim Thomas to the Michigan Supreme Court.
( 23:27 ) We're going to win at every level in Michigan because you're going to turn out and make sure everyone who loves you turns out to vote. Raise your hand and make some noise if you already voted early. Well, we are going to make history because I'm calling it, it's going to be the most voters who've ever voted in a presidential election are voting this year in Michigan. So y'all, in order to make that happen, we got a lot more work to do. Everybody knows 50 people you can talk to who are not going to vote unless they hear from you. So are you committed to making sure that they vote by Tuesday?
Crowd ( 24:15 ):
Garlin Gilchrist ( 24:15 ):
If you're committed, I want to hear you say Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up.
Crowd ( 24:22 ):
Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up. Michigan stand up.
Garlin Gilchrist ( 24:30 ):
Thank you for standing tall for Michigan. MSU, let's do it.
Speaker 1 ( 24:45 ):
Please welcome United States Representative Elissa Slotkin.
Music ( 24:49 ):
Put your hands to the sky.
( 24:51 ) This goes out to the women working hard nine to five.
( 24:51 ) Workin' nine to five.
( 24:51 ) Nine to five.
( 24:51 ) What a way to make a livin'.
( 24:51 ) Barely gettin' by.
( 24:51 ) Get it, girl.
( 24:51 ) It's all takin' and no givin'.
( 24:51 ) They just use your mind and they never give you credit.
( 24:51 ) It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it.
( 24:51 ) Nine to five.
( 24:51 ) Nine to five.
( 24:51 ) For service and devotion.
( 24:51 ) You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion.
( 24:51 ) Want to move ahead-
Elissa Slotkin ( 25:20 ):
Hello, East Lansing and Michigan State University. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I have the honor of being the congresswoman for MSU. So literally now as I run to be the US senator or one of the two US senators for the State of Michigan, it all began in East Lansing at Michigan State University with the students who came out. Now I know we're at a rally. I know we're at a rally. And they've been playing Taylor Swift. The energy is intense here. The energy is intense. The vice president is ready to come out. She's working her way up here.
( 26:16 ) But I just want to say a couple of things. Number one, young people in the State of Michigan have the ability to completely change the outcome of elections. You need to come in, you need to come into your power. And I know something about how important MSU is because I'm running against a guy, his name is Mike Rogers. He's-
Crowd ( 26:41 ):
Elissa Slotkin ( 26:43 ):
We don't boo. We don't need to boo. We don't need to boo. We need to beat him. We need to beat him. That's what we do. So when Mike Rogers, funny fact, when Mike Rogers was running for this seat, this exact seat in 2000,
Elissa Slotkin ( 27:00 ):
He was the closest race in the country. He won by just over 100 votes, literally out of his whole Congressional district. And how did he do that? He passed a law, him and his friends passed a law in the Michigan Senate that specifically targeted college students, specifically said that college students could not vote absentee in their first election. That was specifically, specifically designed to disenfranchise Michigan State students so they couldn't vote on campus, they couldn't vote absentee, and he won that election by a slim margin. So it will be really, really fun in two days when Michigan State University helps beat him in the Senate. It'll be fun. It'll be fun.
( 27:50 ) But look, I want to say specifically to the students, obviously. If you're here, you're politically engaged, you're informed. Many of you have already voted. You know you have friends who are not that way. You know you have friends who you'll have to drag to the polls on Tuesday where you can register same day. Last election, when I won in 2022 here, we had lines outside the Student Union for three hours. I spent almost $10,000 buying pizza. I was out there all night till 11 o'clock. And we need you to do the same thing up and down the ticket. Yes, for the Vice President and yes in my Senate race, but I want to say specifically you heard him tonight, we cannot get back the House of Representatives without Curtis Hertel, and your votes matter the most for his seat. The most. So please drag people, drag them. However you need to do it, drag them there.
( 28:50 ) Now, I want to say also to the students, I am sorry that you have grown up in an era of politics as toxic and as polarized and as angry as this. That's not the way most of us were raised, right? We're not the way we were raised. So I'm sorry that you grew up in this, but your generation has shown over and over again that you have taken this upbringing and said you're not going to sit on the sidelines and let this crap happen in your country. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. So thank you for not turning away from your country in this moment, in what I think of as a decade of political instability. Thank you for turning on, motivating, organizing, and doing the work.
( 29:43 ) Now, I went back in time and I looked at the first big event I had for my campaign when I started running for Senate. You know what date it was? February 13th, 2023. I went from an event in Oakland County, I started driving home to my farm in Holly, and by the time I was turning down my road I got the alert that we were having an active shooter event at MSU. I just kept on driving, spent the evening with the East Lansing Police, and woke up the next morning. I don't remember what I said at the press conference but let me say this to all the MSU students and to all the parents who are watching. We cannot elect people who turn away from the number one killer of children in America. We will not accept people who tell us we can't do anything about it. We can't even try. In fact, trying is some sort of violation of our desires as politicians. We need people who look it dead in the face and say that, just like 20 years ago we didn't wear seat belts and we didn't use car seats and we think now that's crazy, 20 years from now, they're going to look back on this time period and they'll say we let our kids get murdered in their schools and we did nothing about it and this generation along with leaders of principal are going to break that cycle.
( 31:29 ) So don't fall for the people who are too scared to look that in the face, and it is MSU students who taught me that you all know more about active shooter drills and that whole life that goes on in schools than the people who are running the schools. You have to help us and push us and hold us accountable. I hope you do the same thing to me as a Senator. Now, last thing, last thing because we got to get to the main event here, I want to say something specifically. I'm a former CIA officer. I'm a Pentagon official. I did three tours in Iraq alongside the military. And before I ran for office, I was totally non-partisan. I was not political. I wanted to tell you that each and every one of you are here because you love your country and you want it to be better. You should own that patriotism and not give an inch to the pretenders on the other side who wrap themselves in the flag and spit on the values that it represents. Not an inch.
( 32:46 ) If you wrap yourself in the flag and spit on the values it represents you are not a patriot. You are a pretender. So thank you. We are going to get through this period of our history. I think it's about a decade. It's not the only time we've been in this tough situation as a country. We will get through it with two things, engaged citizens and principled leaders. By being here, by coming out, you are engaged citizens and I will do everything, everything in my power to be the principled leader that you deserve. So thank you, Michigan State.

( 01:08:03 ) Okay (okay), alright.
( 01:08:03 ) It's about damn time.
Cedric Hough ( 01:08:21 ):
Go green. That's what I'm talking about. East Lansing, how we doing tonight? Beautiful. Beautiful. Well, my name is Cedric Deion Hough Jr. I'm a senior here at Michigan State University and I'm an organizer. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm also the President of Black Undergraduate Law Association up here. As they said, I'm an organizing fellow for the Michigan One Campaign, and over the last few months, I've been working hard to turn out every last vote on campus at MSU. This will be the first time I ever get the chance to vote in a Presidential election. And I can't thank-
( 01:09:02 ) Y'all got to let me talk now. You got to let you talk now. This will be the first time I ever get the chance to vote in a Presidential election, and I can't think of a more important race to cast my very first ballot. Look, the choice in this election is very clear. On one side, we've got Kamala Harris. They told me y'all were a receptive crowd. I didn't expect y'all to be like this. I love it though. I love it. Someone who has spent her entire life fighting for the people. She is running in this race to lower costs, protect our fundamental rights and make life better for people like you and me. It's amazing. It's amazing.
( 01:09:59 ) On the other hand, we have Donald Trump. Hey, y'all get loud with this one. Y'all get loud with this one. Yeah, yeah. On the other hand, we have Donald Trump who is running to give himself as much power as he possibly can and enact his extreme Project 2025 agenda. As a student and a first-time voter, I'm looking for someone who will fight for me, my future, and everybody else's future in this room and not just himself. Kamala Harris is that candidate. She will protect our reproductive rights. She will bring costs down to give us a chance to buy a home and build our lives. She will forgive billions of student loan debt. She will continue the pursuit of justice that she's done for her entire career. If we do the work over these final two days, we can send Kamala Harris straight to the White House. Now, it doesn't just mean making a plan to vote. It means talking to your friends, rallying your classmates, knocking doors on your community, reaching out to family members and making sure that East Lansing votes for Democrats up and down that ballot for this election. My friends, at this defining moment, at this crossroads in America, it's time to chart a new wave forward for our country. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my profound honor to introduce your Vice President and the next President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.
Music ( 01:11:38 ):
Freedom, Freedom, where are you?
( 01:11:38 ) 'Cause I need freedom, too.
( 01:11:38 ) I break chains all by myself.
( 01:11:59 ) Won't let my freedom rot in hell.
( 01:11:59 ) Hey!
( 01:11:59 ) I'ma keep running 'cause a winner don't quit on themselves.
( 01:12:00 ) I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters.
( 01:12:00 ) Tell the tide, "Don't move"
( 01:12:00 ) I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders.
Kamala Harris ( 01:12:03 ):
Hello, Michigan. Can we hear it for Cedric? We're going to do this. Hello, Michigan State. And it's good to be in the house of my dear friend, Magic Johnson. Go green. All right. All right. East Lansing, are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan and to be with so many incredible leaders. I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, and let's send her to the United States Senate, and Curtis Hertel, and let's send him to the US House of Representatives. And we are joined today by leaders of the Arab American community, which has deep and proud roots here in Michigan.
( 01:14:24 ) And I want to say this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating. And as President, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination. And we continue to work on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border to protect civilians and provide lasting stability. And as President, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people.
( 01:15:45 ) So Michigan, two days to go. You ready? You ready? In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have momentum, it is on our side. Can you feel it? And we have the momentum because our campaign is tapping into the ambitions, the aspirations, and the dreams of the American people because we are optimistic and excited about what we can do together. And because we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. Now, the race is not yet over and we need to finish strong, so for the next two days, we still have a lot of work to do. But here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win.
( 01:17:52 ) And we will win, because here's what everyone here knows. When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division. We are done with that and we are exhausted with it. And America is ready. America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. We are ready for a President who knows that the true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It is based on who you lift up. And Michigan, you know me. I am not afraid of tough fights, evidently. For decades as a prosecutor and the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners. I won fights against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. I won fights against predators who abused women, children, and seniors. I won fights. I won fights against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you. If you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.
( 01:19:56 ) I'm here for you and I will get up every day to fight, to make your life better, to bring down the cost of living, to ban corporate price gouging on groceries, to make housing and child care more affordable. My plan will cut taxes for workers, for middle-class families, and small businesses, lower healthcare costs, including the cost of home care for seniors. Because, by the way, I believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And to those certain individuals
Kamala Harris ( 01:21:00 ):
Individuals who still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and take us back to the days when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, you all know what we say, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom, including the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, you know where I'm going, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.
( 01:22:24 ) So Michigan, I am here to ask for your vote. I am here to ask for your vote. And here is my pledge to you, as president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. And I pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I pledge to listen to experts. And I pledge to listen to people who disagree with me because, you see, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. In fact, I'll give them a seat at the table because that's what strong leaders do. And I pledge to always put country above party and self. And to be a president for all Americans. For all Americans. So that is my pledge to you East Lansing.
( 01:24:11 ) And let me then ask, who here has already voted?
( 01:24:15 ) Wow, that's fantastic. Thank you. All right, okay.
( 01:24:33 ) Well now, I got to ask you, please talk to your friends, and family, and neighbors and share your perspective on why this election is so important. Share your perspective on why with the many, many other things you could be doing with your time right now, you took time out of your busy lives to be here. Let's connect with each other and let folks know, and encourage them to make their voices heard.
( 01:25:03 ) And for those of you who haven't voted yet, no judgment. No judgment. But please do take a moment and think about your plan for when and where you will vote. Election day is on Tuesday, November 5th. Polls are open here in Michigan from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. And if you are not yet registered to vote, you can register and vote at your local clerk's office now through election day. It's a very big deal. That's a very big deal. So go to IWillVote.com for all the information you need, including when and where to vote, and where to drop off your absentee ballot. But we need everyone to vote in Michigan. You will make the difference in this election. You will make the difference. You will make the difference.
Audience Member ( 01:26:00 ):
We love you.
Kamala Harris ( 01:26:10 ):
I love you back. I love you back.
Audience ( 01:26:17 ):
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
Kamala Harris ( 01:26:24 ):
Okay, so here's the thing, it all comes down to this, we are here together, this incredible mix of people from every background, every stage of life under one roof together. And we are here together for many reasons, including because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism, the expression of the love we have for our country to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what we are about. That's what we are about.
( 01:27:23 ) And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. So I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to the marches when I was in a stroller. And there were people there and history has told us there were people there from every walk of life coming together to fight for freedom and for opportunity. Growing up, I saw how hard our mother worked to give her daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love who instilled in me the values of community, compassion and faith.
( 01:28:23 ) I have spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but who never stopped believing that in our country, anything is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And I will tell you today, I see the promise of America in everyone who is here, in all of you, in all us. We are the promise of America, we are we are. We are the promise of America. And I see it in the fathers and the mothers and the grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future. I see it in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. I see it in the men that support them. I see it in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before, but have put the constitution of the United States above party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are here and voting for the first time.
( 01:29:47 ) I love Gen Z. I do. I do. And here's one of the things that I love about this generation, you, this incredible generation, you all are rightly impatient for change. I know that. I know that. I know that about you. And here's the thing, 'cause you all have only known the climate crisis and are leading then, the charge to protect our planet and our future. You who grew up with active shooter drills and are fighting to keep our schools safe. You who know now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers are standing up for freedom. None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all. This is your lived experience. And I see you and I see your power and I'm so proud of you.
( 01:31:04 ) Can we hear it for our first time voters?
( 01:31:17 ) Yeah, I'm telling you, this is why I know our future is bright. I'm just so optimistic about it. I'm so optimistic about it.
( 01:31:29 ) All right. All right, two days. We have two days to get this done. And nobody can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next two days so that when we look back, we have no regrets that we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors, let's text, let's call the voters. Let's reach out to family, friends, classmates, neighbors, co-workers. And as we do, I have one request on top of everything else I've asked of you, let's be true to what our campaign has been about from the very start, which is to be intentional about building community. Let's build community while we are doing this. Let's build community and be intentional about it.
( 01:32:28 ) Let's be intentional about building coalitions because we know, look, there's been so much about this last decade that is just… But the thing is that the tenor of it has been to try and make people feel alone. And when you make people feel alone, it's a way of trying to disempower people. To suggest to them you don't have people. To suggest to them you don't have community, which is not true. And that's why I say let's be intentional about in the face of a stranger, seeing a neighbor and understanding that our power to lift each other up is immense. And let us do it with the spirit of knowing, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
( 01:33:22 ) And we are all in this together. We are all in this together because from the very start, our campaign has not been about being against something. It is about being for something. A fight for a future with freedom, opportunity and dignity for all Americans. And so, in these final hours, let us remember that there is power in knowing that we are together. And let us remember that your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. And you are powerful. And you remember that.
( 01:34:19 ) So today, Michigan, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.
