 >> NOHE GRAF: HELLO, AND WELCOME TO THIS GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE FOR U.S. SENATE.
THIS DEBATE IS SPONSORED BY CLEAN ELECTION, THE STATE'S NONPARTISAN VOTER EDUCATION AGENCY.
MY NAME IS NOHELANI GRAF.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: AND I'M STEVE GOLDSTEIN.
WE'LL BE CO-MODERATING TODAY'S DEBATE.
THANKS TO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CLEAN ELECTIONS COMMISSION, THE ARIZONA MEDIA ASSOCIATION, AND BITFIRE STUDIOS, WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THESE 2024 DEBATES ARE THE MOST ACCESSIBLE IN ARIZONA HISTORY.
THAT MEANS THIS DEBATE WILL AIR ON A LONG LIST OF LOCAL TV STATIONS, RADIO STATIONS AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS, INCLUDING SUPPORT FROM LOCAL NEWSPAPERS.
>> NOHE GRAF: BEFORE WE GET TO THE RULES, WE WANT TO THANK BOTH CANDIDATES TO THE STAGE, DEMOCRAT RUBEN GALLEGO AND REPUBLICAN KARI LAKE.
WE THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.
WE DO WANT FOR THE BENEFIT OF VOTERS WATCHING OR LISTENING FROM HOME TO BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE AGREED-UPON RULES FOR THE HOUR AHEAD.
EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT, AND ONE MINUTE FOR A CLOSING STATEMENT.
CANDIDATES HAVE DRAWN STRAWS TO DETERMINE THAT ORDER.
THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE, WE WILL POSE QUESTIONS TO EACH CANDIDATE, ALLOW THEM TO ANSWER, AND THEN MAKE SURE THE OTHER CANDIDATE HAS A CHANCE TO RESPOND.
WHENEVER A QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE, ONLY THAT CANDIDATE'S MICROPHONE WILL BE OPEN.
AT ALL OTHER TIMES, EVERY MICROPHONE WILL BE OPEN.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THIS DEBATE BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED AT LEAST 1% OF THE TOTAL BALLOTS CAST IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION.
WE'VE USED THIS GUIDELINE FOR ALL OF OUR GENERAL ELECTION DEBATES IN ARIZONA THIS FALL.
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE TOPICS THAT LEAD FOR VOTERS IN ARIZONA.
WE'LL SPEND MORE TIME ON THOSE KEY ISSUES AND TRY TO GET TO AS MANY OF THE OTHER TOPICS AS TIME ALLOWS.
ALSO, NO CANDIDATE HAS BEEN GIVEN ADVANCED ACCESS TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS.
MR. GALLEGO, TWO MINUTES FOR YOUR OPENING STATEMENT.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THANK YOU.
I'M RUBEN GALLEGO, HUSBAND, FATHER, MARINE COMBAT VETERAN AND A PROUD, PROUD ARIZONIAN.
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING YOUR U.S.
SENATOR.
I WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND SHE RAISED US ALL ON A SECRETARY'S SALARY.
I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR SO MY SISTERS COULD HAVE THEIR OWN BED.
AND MY FIRST BED WAS ACTUALLY MY COLLEGE DORM ROOM BED.
I WORKED EVERY JOB I COULD FIND, MUCH LIKE MANY ARIZONIANS DO NOW, JUST TO MAKE SURE I COULD HELP OUT, WHETHER IT WAS CONSTRUCTION, MEAT PACKING FACTORY, DRYWALL, WHATEVER I COULD DO, JUST TO HELP A LITTLE MORE.
I GOT INTO HARVARD AND ENLISTED.
WENT TO IRAQ AND SERVED WITH THE BEST MEN I EVER MET.
THERE I SAW SOME OF THE HARDEST DAYS IN COMBAT AND LOST CLOSE, CLOSE FRIENDS.
BUT I DID LEARN IN WAR, THERE ARE NO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, JUST YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TRYING TO LIVE ONE MORE DAY AND BE BETTER AMERICANS.
THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN TRAVELING THE STATE, TALKING TO ARIZONIANS WHO JUST WANT A BETTER FUTURE.
IN CONTRAST, WE'RE GOING TO SEE AND TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY FAILED THE TEST OF HONESTY.
SHE LIED TO ARIZONIANS ABOUT THE 2022 ELECTION.
SHE HAS SAID SHE STILL IS THE RIGHTFUL GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA.
SHE'S LIED ABOUT FELLOW REPUBLICANS TO THE POINT THEY HAD TO GO GET BODYGUARDS BECAUSE OF ALL THE THREATS THAT SHE CREATED.
WE ARE AT A CROSS ROADS, ARIZONA.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE, ENSURE OUR WATER RIGHTS, CONTINUE THIS GREAT GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THAT WE ACTUALLY PROTECT ABORTION RIGHTS.
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GO.
AND THAT'S THE OPTIONS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> KARI LAKE, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> KARI LAKE: THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN TONIGHT FOR THIS IMPORTANT DEBATE.
IT REMINDS ME OF THE DAY I DROVE INTO TOWN IN 1994.
I WAS 24 YEARS OLD.
I BOUGHT A HOUSE FOR $88,000, A THREE-BEDROOM HOME.
ARIZONA WAS AFFORDABLE BACK THEN.
ARIZONA WAS SAFE BACK THEN, AND ARIZONA WAS A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE WANTED TO COME TO LIVE.
AND NOW UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT ANYMORE.
ARIZONA HAS BECOME UNAFFORDABLE AND UNSAFE BECAUSE OF CAREER POLITICIANS WHO HAVE VOTED AGAINST OUR NEEDS AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR SAFETY.
WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING TONIGHT FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS UNDERGONE AN EXTREME MAKEOVER TO QUOTE AN OLD TV SHOW, SOMEBODY WHO HAS VOTED WITH THE MOST RADICAL DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON, D.C., TO TEAR OPEN OUR BORDERS THAT WERE DELIVERED TO HIM IN A SAFE WAY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SECURING OUR BORDER, WHO HAS TORN APART OUR ECONOMY, AND WHO HAS MADE OUR CHILDREN AND OUR LIVES LESS SAFE.
AND SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO WATCH AS SOMEBODY TRIES TO REINVENT HIMSELF, SOMEBODY WHO USED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS, SOMEBODY WHO HAS DESTROYED THE VERY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT THAT HE HAS SERVED FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS, WHERE HOMELESSNESS IS ON THE RISE.
THE FASTEST GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION WHERE QUALITY OF LIFE IS DIMINISHED.
WE WANT TO GET BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE ARIZONA WAS AFFORDABLE AND SAFE.
WHEN WE PUT AMERICA FIRST, WE CAN DO THAT.
WE NEED TO PUT OUR COUNTRY OVER OUR PARTY.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
COUNTRY OVER PARTY.
AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICA FIRST IS ALL ABOUT.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MAN I'M STANDING ON THE STAGE WITH TONIGHT, HE TOOK AN OATH TO PROTECT US FROM ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, AND WE'VE SEEN ENEMIES COME ACROSS OUR BORDER.
WE'VE HAD 20 MILLION PEOPLE COME ACROSS OUR BORDER.
CRIMINALS HAVE COME IN AND TERRORISTS HAVE COME IN.
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP SECURE THAT BORDER.
BRING BACK THAT STRONG TRUMP ECONOMY, MAKE IT SO WE CAN HAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM ONCE AGAIN FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATE TONIGHT AND I THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN.
>> NOHE GRAF: THANK YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE BORDER THIS EVENING.
AND WE HAVE SEPARATED THIS TOPIC INTO TWO CATEGORIES, BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM.
MR. GALLEGO, YOU WERE ONE OF THE EARLIEST AND MOST EMPHATIC CRITICS OF A BORDER WALL.
HAS YOUR PERSPECTIVE CHANGED ON THAT?
HOW MUCH OF A ROLE DOES A BORDER WALL NEED TO PLAY IN AN OVERALL SECURITY PACKAGE?
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: I THINK A BORDER WALL IS IMPORTANT TO A SECURITY PACKAGE, BUT IT HAS TO BE COUPLED WITH TECHNOLOGY, MANPOWER AND LAWS THAT COME BEHIND THAT.
THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THE BORDER BILL PASSED.
I HAVE VOTED FOR BORDER WALLS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE WHERE APPROPRIATE, WITH THE PROPER MANPOWER AND STAFFING, IT DOES WORK.
WHAT DOESN'T WORK IS WHEN YOU PUT A BORDER WALL WITHOUT THE MANPOWER AND THE MAN HOURS YOU NEED TO PUT BEHIND IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T END OF BEING OF USE AND IT COSTS US MORE MONEY.
THIS IS WHY WE FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE THE BORDER SECURITY BILL.
IT WAS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THE BORDER PATROL WANTED AND ENFORCED.
IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS, THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM JUDGES, THOUSANDS OF I.C.E.
AGENTS, AS WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED AT THE BORDER.
I HEARD FROM THE PORT UNION, THE MAYORS THAT I VISITED, COUNTY OFFICIALS AND THEY NEEDED THIS AND THEY WANTED THIS.
THIS IS WHY IT WAS VERY, VERY SAD THAT KARI LAKE CAME OUT AND WAS AGAINST THAT BILL.
EVEN AFTER IT WAS BROKEN OFF FROM FOREIGN POLICY AID.
NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A BETTER OPTION, BUT BECAUSE SHE NEEDS IT TO BE A BORDER PROBLEM, BECAUSE THAT SOLUTION WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE UNDER CONTROL.
AND LOOK, FROM DAY ONE, I WORKED IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER WHEN IT COMES TO THIS.
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WHEN I GOT TO CONGRESS WAS WORK WITH A REPUBLICAN FROM SOUTHERN ARIZONA TO GET VETERANS TO JOIN BORDER PATROL.
EVEN RECENTLY, I SIGNED ON TO A BILL, THE ONLY DEMOCRAT TO SIGN ON TO A BILL WITH REPRESENTATIVE CRENSHAW OF TEXAS TO GET MORE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY JOIN BORDER PATROL, SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT AND SOMETHING THE BORDER AGENTS THEMSELVES TOLD ME THEY WANTED TO DO.
>> NOHE GRAF: THANK YOU, MRS. LAKE, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU -- >> KARI LAKE: CAN I RESPOND TO THAT?
>> NOHE GRAF: I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT THE BORDER WALL.
CAN IT UPSTAND AND WITHHOLD WITHOUT ADDING EXTRA SECURITY?
>> KARI LAKE: RUBEN CALLED IT THE DUMB STUPID BORDER WALL AND HE WROTE AN OP ED, WHY WE SHOULDN'T BUILD TRUMP'S WALL EVER.
RUBEN HAS VOTED AGAINST BORDER SECURITY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
REMEMBER, I COVERED THE STATE FOR 27 YEARS.
I WAS IN YOUR HOME.
ALL THAT TIME, WE WATCHED AS CAREER POLITICIANS SAID THEY WERE GOING TO SECURE THE BORDER AND GIVE US BORDER SECURITY AND THEY NEVER DID UNTIL PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME ALONG AND ACTUALLY SECURED THE BORDER, BUT HE HAD TO DO IT WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND HIS BACK BECAUSE MY OPPONENT FOUGHT HIM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
THAT BORDER WALL KEEPS US SAFE.
WE'VE SEEN IT HERE IN ARIZONA BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE BORDER WALL IS THERE AND PEOPLE AREN'T COMING THROUGH.
WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN IT, PEOPLE ARE POURING THROUGH.
AND RUBEN GALLEGO HAS SUPPORTED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, KAMALA HARRIS, THE BORDER CZAR, WHICH LET IN 20 MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING CRIMINALS AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO SECURE THE BORDER.
THE ONLY PIECE OF LEGISLATION MR. GALLEGO HAS PUT FORTH WAS NOT ABOUT BORDER SECURITY.
IT WAS ABOUT REMOVING THE WORD ILLEGAL ALIEN FROM ANYTHING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAPERWORK.
HE'S MORE WORRIED ABOUT SEMANTICS THAN OUR SECURITY.
AND RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TERRORISTS COMING THROUGH.
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT A POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACK ON OUR HOME SOIL.
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO FOR A JOG IN THE MORNING AND NOT HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT BEING RAPED OR MURDERED.
I WANT TO FINISH THE BORDER WALL.
ON DAY ONE, MY FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL BE TO FULLY FUND AND EXPEDITE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BORDER WALL.
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE ALREADY PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS TO DO THAT.
BUT RUBEN GALLEGO AND KAMALA HARRIS, THEY SOLD THAT $325 MILLION OF BORDER MATERIAL FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR.
THEY GAVE IT AWAY.
WE COULD HAVE HAD THAT WALL FINISHED.
>> NOHE GRAF: SO IN ADDITION TO FINISHING THE WALL, DO YOU ADD SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY?
DO YOU SPEND ON THAT AS WELL?
>> KARI LAKE: ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO ENOUGH TO SECURE OUR BORDER.
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING ARIZONIANS AND OUR WHOLE COUNTRY.
EVERY STATE IS A BORDER STATE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THIS MAN'S POLICIES, THIS MAN'S VOTE, WHICH HAVE BEEN 100% OPEN BORDER.
HE SIDED WITH THE CARTELS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND YOU AND I ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF IT.
>> NOHE GRAF: MR. GALLEGO, A MINUTE TO RESPOND.
AND DO YOU SUPPORT OPEN BORDERS?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: ABSOLUTELY NOT, I DO NOT SUPPORT OPEN BORDERS.
A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A BORDER CONTROLLED IS NOT A COUNTRY.
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT.
TO SAY THAT, I'VE BEEN VERY PROUD TO MAKE SURE IN MY TIME IN CONGRESS, I HAVE VOTED AND BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS TO ARIZONA.
I HAVE VOTED AND FUNDED WHERE NEEDED AND WHERE EXPERTS WANTED.
THIS IS WHY I'M IN FAVOR OF THE COMPROMISE BILL SUPPORTED BY THE BORDER PATROL BILL AND KARI LAKE CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY SHE WAS AGAINST THAT BILL.
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT FROM BORDER MAYORS THAN SHE DOES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE'S ONE BORDER MAYOR THAT STARTED WITH HER ON THE CAMPAIGN, MET WITH HER IN FRONT OF THE BORDER WALL WITH HER CAMPAIGN SIGN AND IS NOW SUPPORTING US, BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE NOT JUST TALK, WE'RE NOT JUST RETINAL PRICK, WE'RE HERE TO BRING THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY CONTROL THE BORDER AND NOT JUST USE IT AS A TALKING POINT WHICH IS WHAT KARI LAKE DOES.
>> KARI LAKE: HE VOTED AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY OP THE BORDER.
WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE IN ARIZONA WHO WERE DONATING MONEY TO HIS CAMPAIGN, HE SAID HE'S NOT AN EXPERT ON THE BORDER.
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE THREAT ON THE BORDER.
I DO.
ON DAY ONE, WE'RE GOING TO GET BUSY UNDOING THE DAMAGE DONE BY KAMALA HARRIS, PRESIDENT BIDEN AND RUBEN GALLEGO.
CAN YOU IMAGINE VOTING WITH KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN 100% OF THE TIME ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER.
WE'VE GOT 20 MILLION PEOPLE POURING IN.
THEY'RE TAKING JOBS, THEY'RE TAKING HOUSING.
THIS IS WHY NOBODY CAN AFFORD HOUSING BEFORE.
WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH PEOPLE WHO COME IN ILLEGALLY.
I AM COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO AN OPEN BORDER.
I AM 100% FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW CAME HERE LEGALLY, AND ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE IMMIGRANTS OF THIS COUNTRY WHO CAME HERE LEGALLY ARE HORRIFIED BY THE PHOTOS THAT MY OPPONENT HAS TAKEN.
THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY WHAT KAMALA HARRIS HAS DONE.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.
I AM NOT FOR IT.
AND IT'S BECAUSE IT WOULD CODIFY INTO LAW 5,000 PEOPLE EVERY DAY COMING IN ILLEGALLY.
THAT MEANS 5,000 PEOPLE EVERY DAY WOULD BE POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER ILLEGALLY.
THAT LAW DID NOTHING TO STOP CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING.
350,000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED ACROSS OUR BORDER SINCE RUBEN GALLEGO AND KAMALA HARRIS OPENED UP THAT BORDER.
350,000.
AND THEY LOST TRACK OF THEM.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: ARE THERE ANY ELEMENTS OF THE BORDER BILL THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED?
>> KARI LAKE: ACTUALLY NO, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DONE PROPERLY.
THEY MEET IN BACK ROOMS.
THEY SAY LET'S PUT A BORDER DEAL TOGETHER.
WHATEVER THEY CALL IT.
THEY ALWAYS CALL IT SOMETHING AND IT'S USUALLY THE OPPOSITE.
THEN THEY THROW A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF IN THERE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I HAD A REAL PROBLEM WITH, STEVE, WAS THAT THEY ATTACHED IT TO $115 BILLION IN MONEY, OUR MONEY, ARIZONA'S MONEY GOING OVERSEAS TO KILL PEOPLE.
AND WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET THIS PASSED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, THEY CONTINUED TO PUSH THIS BUT THERE WAS NO BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
THREE PEOPLE SUPPORTING IT, THE SENATORS WEREN'T BIPARTISAN BEHIND IT.
AND IN THE HOUSE, THEY WEREN'T SUPPORTING IT EITHER.
AND THE PEOPLE WEREN'T SUPPORTING IT.
SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY SEPARATED IT OUT AND RUBEN GALLEGO VOTED TO SEND ANOTHER $60 BILLION TO UKRAINE.
AND AFTER THAT VOTE, HE SAW SHADE AROUND THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS WAVING A UKRAINIAN FLAG.
I WANT TO ASK THE VETERANS OUT THERE, CAN YOU EVER IMAGINE STANDING ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS AND WAVING THE FLAG OF ANOTHER COUNTRY?
THAT'S WHAT THIS GENTLEMAN DID.
HE SOLD US OUT, HE SOLD US OUT TO UKRAINE.
HE SPENT $260 BILLION.
HE VOTED FOR EVERY PENNY OF THAT, BUT HE WOULD NOT HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP BUILD THE BORDER WALL.
EVEN WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TO THE DEMOCRATS, I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO DACA.
I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO DACA, LET'S MAKE THEM CITIZENS IN EXCHANGE FOR HELPING ME COME UP WITH MONEY TO BUILD THE BORDER WALL.
AND RUBEN GALLEGO SAID NO.
THEY'RE USING THESE DACA RECIPIENTS AS POLITICAL PAWNS.
I FIND THAT DISGUSTING.
WHY ARE YOU USING THEM AS PAWNS?
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE A DEAL WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DREAMERS -- >> RUBEN GALLEGO: I WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN I WAS NEGOTIATED THIS WITH GENERAL KELLY, THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WE DID AGREE TO GIVE THE BORDER WALL FOR DREAMERS.
HE CAME BACK AND SAID WELL, NOW, WE WANT TO BRING DOWN LEGAL MIGRATION, TAKE OUT GREEN CARDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
>> KARI LAKE: THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE.
INSTEAD OF 650,000 -- >> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: LET HIM ANSWER FIRST, PLEASE.
>> KARI LAKE: PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIPLE I HAD.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: I PROMISE YOU A REBUTTAL.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE DREAMERS STATUS?
KARI LAKE HAS DODGED THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DREAMERS.
IS SHE GOING TO DEPORT THE DREAMERS IN THIS COUNTRY?
I DON'T THINK DREAMERS SHOULD BE DEPORTED.
KARI LAKE AVOIDS THESE CARD A NSWERS.
AND THE BILL WAS SEPARATED.
SO EVENTUALLY, AFTER PRESSURES FROM KARI LAKE WHO JUST WANT A BORDER PROBLEM WON THE DAY AND THE REPUBLICANS WALKED AWAY FROM A BIPARTISAN BILL, THEY SEPARATED IT OUT TO HAVE A SEPARATE BILL ONLY ON THE BORDER AND KARI LAKE AGAIN VOTED NO.
THIS IS WHY SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF BORDER MAYORS.
WE HAVE 45 REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE NOW CROSSED TO SUPPORT.
THEY UNDERSTAND, WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, NOT JUST THE CAMPAIGN RHETORIC.
>> KARI LAKE: WE JUST LEARNED THIS WEEK THAT ROUGHLY 35,000 PEOPLE CAME ACROSS WHO KNEW HAD CRIMINAL RECORDS.
50,000, 60,000 OF THEM WERE CONVICTED RAPIST AND MURDERS.
THIS LEGISLATION WAS A DISASTER.
IT WOULD HAVE CODIFIED CATCH AND RELEASE.
HR-2 WILL SECURE THE BORDER, THAT AND CONSTRUCTING THE BORDER WALL QUICKLY, AND THEN DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE WHO POURED IN DURING THE BIDEN INVASION, THE 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME IN UNVETTED INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE MUST DEAL WITH THEM IN ORDER TO SAVE YOUR HOMELAND.
WE MUST SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR HOMELAND.
I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAME IN UNVETTED IN THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DREAMERS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS, DO YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM HERE?
DO YOU WANT TO DEPORT ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO INVADED OUR COUNTRY IN THE LAST 3 1/2 YEARS, RUBEN?
DO YOU WANT TO DEPORT ANY OF THEM?
>> NOHE GRAF: 30 SECONDS.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: YES, WE SHOULD HAVE A PROPER DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS.
BUT I ALSO THINK WE SHOULDN'T DEPORT DREAMERS.
>> KARI LAKE: 20 MILLION OF THEM?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THERE'S NOT 20 MILLION DREAMERS.
>> SISTER GONG: LET'S TALK ABOUT DREAMERS.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: YOU ARE NOT MADE CLEAR, WOULD YOU -- >> KARI LAKE: YOU HAD A CHANCE TO MIKE A DEAL AND USED THEM AS POLITICAL PAWNS.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: SHE SAID SHE'S GOING TO DEPORT PEOPLE.
WILL YOU DEPORT DREAMERS, YES OR NO?
>> KARI LAKE: NO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL WHEN IT CAME TO DREAMERS.
YOU SAID NO.
UNFORTUNATELY THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS LIKE MY OPPONENT WOULD RATHER USE PEOPLE AS POLITICAL PAWNS.
I WANT TO SECURE THE BORDER AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT.
AND RIGHT NOW, WE'VE WATCHED.
>> NOHE GRAF: MRS. LAKE IN JUST A MOMENT -- >> KARI LAKE: PEOPLE LIKE LAKEN RILEY'S LIFE HAS BEEN SNUFFED OUT.
HE'S ALLOWED THE CARTELS, HE'S EMPOWERED THEM TO CONTINUE TO FUNNEL FENTANYL IN.
>> NOHE GRAF: AND MRS. LAKE, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, THROUGH AUGUST OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL REPORTED MORE THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE CAUGHT CROSSING ILLEGALLY OR DEEMED INADMISSIBLE.
500,000 POUNDS OF DRUGS SEIZED AT PORTS OF ENTRY.
WHAT IS THE BIGGER THREAT TO YOU, THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS OR THE FLOW OF DRUGS?
>> KARI LAKE: THEY BOTH ARE TERRIBLE.
IT'S A WAR AGAINST AMERICA.
WE HAVE AN INVASION OF PEOPLE COMING IN.
I REMEMBER SEEING A VIDEO -- THEY LOOKED LIKE SOLDIERS COMING IN, SOLDIERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES COMING IN AND POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER.
THEN WE HAVE OUR CARTELS EMPOWERED BY RUBEN GALLEGO TRAFFICKING DRUGS INTO OUR STATE.
WE ARE THE FUNNEL FOR FENTANYL.
I HAVE MET SO MANY PARENTS AND LOVED ONES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHO COME UP TO ME.
AND THEY WAIT USUALLY UNTIL THE END OF AN EVENT.
YOU CAN SPOT IT.
THERE'S A SORROW THAT YOU SEE IN THEIR FACE.
THEY COME UP TO ME AT THE END OF AN EVENT AND THEY SAY I LOST MY SON.
HE WAS 16 YEARS OLD.
HE TOOK HALF OF WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A XANAX PILL AND HE'S NOT WITH US.
20-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, A YOUNG MOTHER.
WE ARE LOSING A GENERATION OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE LOSING AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER, RUBEN.
YOU HAVE ADMITTED THAT YOU HAVE A LOVED ONE WHO WAS A CONVICTED FELON DRUG TRAFFICKER WHO'S TRAFFICKED DRUGS INTO OUR COUNTRY.
>> NOHE GRAF: MR. GALLEGO, ONE MINUTE TO RESPOND TO THAT.
>> KARI LAKE: I WANT TO RESPOND.
I FEEL FOR YOU, A CLOSE RELATIVE OF YOURS.
AND TO KEEP BRINGING FENTANYL INTO OUR COUNTRY, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SORROW -- >> NOHE GRAF: MR. GALLEGO, ONE MINUTE.
>> KARI LAKE: HE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY MEMBER WHO TRAFFICKED DRUGS AND HOW HARD IT WAS FOR HIM.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR FAMILIES IS YOU'RE MAKING THAT A REALITY.
>> NOHE GRAF: MR. GALLEGO?
>> KARI LAKE: YOU HAVE EMPOWERED THE CARTELS.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: I WAS ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT TO A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT MORE TECHNOLOGY TO THE BORDER, THAT WOULD HAVE CHECKED ALL THE SCANNERS.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT WAS IN THE BILL THAT KARI LAKE AGAIN STOOD IS UP AND SAID DO NOT PASS IT.
NOT BECAUSE IT WASN'T A GOOD SOLUTION BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO AN END.
SHE NEEDS THIS TALKING POINT.
I TAKE THIS SO SERIOUSLY AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.
I ACTUALLY INTRODUCED A BILL CALLED THE BUCK STOPS HERE, WHICH HELPS US TRACK DOWN THE SOURCES OF MONEY THAT GOES TO FENTANYL, ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA TO MEXICO TO THE UNITED STATES.
I DO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
AGAIN, THIS IS WHY I HAVE MORE SUPPORT TO ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THIS STATE THAN SHE DOES.
BORDER MAYORS THAT USED TO CAMPAIGN WITH HER ARE NOW CAMPAIGNING WITH ME BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THAT SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE 45 REPUBLICAN, AGAIN, THAT AREN'T CAMPAIGNING WITH HER.
AND WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE, DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN WITH HER ANYMORE EITHER.
HE'S NOT ALLOWING HER PICTURES ON ANY OF HIS BILLBOARDS.
A CANDIDATE THAT CAN ONLY TALK BUT DOESN'T PRODUCE RESULTS.
>> NOHE GRAF: ONE OF THE IMPACTS THAT WE SEE THAT'S BEING FELT BY BORDER TOWNS THAT WE HEARD FROM IN QUESTIONS IT?
ED BY BORDERS IS THE HOSPITALS IN BORDER TOWNS ARE SPENDING ON MEDICAL CARE FOR MIGRANTS.
FOOD BANKS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED AND CONTINUE TO BE STRETCHED.
AND NOW LOCALS ARE WORRIED THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES LEFT FOR THEM.
SO HOW DO YOU RECTIFY OR REGULATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH FOR-PROFIT AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, TWO MINUTES.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, ACTUALLY.
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, ESPECIALLY, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING MONEY TO OUR BORDER COMMUNITIES.
THIS IS MONEY THAT'S BEEN ASKED BY YUMA COUNTY, SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.
>> KARI LAKE: BUT YOU WON'T GIVE MONEY TO THE NGO'S.
HE WANTS TO FUND THE NGO'S THAT -- >> NOHE GRAF: I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ESSENTIAL IN MAKING SURE THESE STREETS AREN'T FULL OF MEN JUST WALKING AROUND, RIGHT?
SO WHAT THEY DO WITH HELP FROM US THROUGH FEMA, WHICH BY THE WAY, SHE WANTS TO CUT THESE FUNDS, IS WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE MIGRANTS AREN'T AFFECTING THESE SMALL TOWNS.
THEY CAN'T TAKE THAT IMPACT, AND THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY, HOSPITALS, FIREFIGHTERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AMBULANCES, THAT THEY'RE ALL REIMBURSED.
KARI LAKE, I MEAN, SHE WILL DO ANYTHING AND SAY ANYTHING TO GAIN POWER, INCLUDING LIAR.
>> KARI LAKE: I HAVEN'T HAD A VOTE ON THIS.
YOU'VE VOTED FOR THIS FOR 10 YEAR, RUBEN.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: SHE HAS SAID -- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY, RUBEN?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WE APPROPRIATED MONEY SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BORDER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY WERE ASKED FOR BY THESE MAYORS.
NOW SHE SAYS WE SHOULD CUT THAT.
WE SHOULD CUT THAT.
THESE MAYORS -- SO I HOPE YOU'LL CALL THE MAYOR OF DOUGLAS, THE MAYOR OF NOGALES, THE MAYOR OF YUMA.
HEY, BECAUSE I WANT TO EARN POINTS WITH RIGHT-WING TALK SHOWS, I'M GOING TO CUT THESE FUNDS.
SHE'S LYING THAT THE MONEY TO FEMA CAME FROM THAT FUND.
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING DIRECTLY TO THEM.
BUT OF COURSE, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
AS LONG AS SHE GETS TO GET HER TALKING POINTS IN AND GETS TO LIE AND GET POWER, ARIZONA, ESPECIALLY BORDER COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO GET HURT.
>> NOHE GRAF: HOW DO YOU RECTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FOR THOSE BORDER COMMUNITIES.
>> KARI LAKE: IT'S HORRIFYING, HOSPITALS HAVING TO BE CLOSED DOWN, HOSPITALS NOT BEING PAID BECAUSE PEOPLE CROSSING ILLEGALLY ARE GETTING SERVICES.
AND RUBEN'S IDEA IS ACTUALLY FUNNEL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE NGO'S THAT ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PART IN TRANSPORTING PEOPLE FURTHER INTO OUR COUNTRY, NOT JUST HERE IN ARIZONA.
GO TO THE AIRPORT.
TAKE A RED EYE OUT OF PHOENIX SKY HARBOR, IT LOOKS LIKE A MIGRANT ENCAMPMENT.
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING FROM PHOENIX SKY HARBOR TO ALL 50 STATES.
AND RUBEN GALLEGO HAS FUNDED THAT.
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
THE REAL ANSWER, THE REAL SOLUTION, ARIZONA, IS NOT TO HAVE TO POUR BILLIONS INTO ALL OF THIS, IS TO SHUT DOWN THE BORDER.
BUILD THE BORDER WALL THAT HE CALLS A DUMB, STUPID BORDER WALL.
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO POUR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE NGO'S.
THE REAL SOLUTION TO HELP THESE BORDER COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY AREN'T TAKING A FINANCIAL HIT IS TO FINALLY PUT THE BORDER WALL UP AND GET SERIOUS ABOUT BORDER SECURITY.
BUT MR. GALLEGO WOULD RATHER POUR $260 BILLION OF YOUR HARD-EARNED TAX DOLLARS INTO UKRAINE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR BORDER, NOT OUR BORDERS.
I WANT TO PROTECT YOU.
THAT'S BY PRESIDENT TRUMP, MY GOOD FRIEND, HAS CALLED ME BORDER KARI LAKE.
I LOVE THE NICKNAME AND I'M GOING TO GO THERE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND HELP HIM BUILD THAT BORDER WALL AND SECURE THE BORDER.
WE CAN'T AFFORD WHAT KAMALA HARRIS AND RUBEN GALLEGO HAS DONE.
HE'S VOTED WITH THEM 100% OF THE TIME.
FENTANYL IS FALLING INTO THE HAND OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
IT'S AFFECTING OUR ECONOMY.
IF YOU'RE WORKING ONE OR TWO JOBS, WHEN YOU BRING 20 MILLION PEOPLE IN, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING FOR PEANUTS, ESPECIALLY UNDER GALLEGO'S PLAN WHICH IS TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING AND GIVE THEM AN EBT CARD WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON IT TO PAY FOR THEIR FOOD.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONTHLY EXPENSES TO LIVE.
SO THEY CAN WORK FOR A REDUCED WAGE, IT BRINGS YOUR WAGES DOWN AND ALL FAMILIES HAVE TO STRUGGLE MORE.
ASK OUR POLICE ABOUT IT.
HOW MANY OF YOU OUT THERE KNOW SOMEBODY ARE A VICTIM OF CRIME FROM THESE CHILEAN GANGS, THE DINNER TIME BANDITS THAT BROKE INTO HOME AND ARE TERRORIZING PEOPLE.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: I'LL GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THIS MONEY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN REQUESTED BY THE COMMUNITIES.
THIS MONEY HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY NOGALES, MY SANTA CRUZ.
THEY ASKED US TO WORK WITH THESE NON-PROFITS TO RELEASE THE PRESSURE THAT THEY HAVE.
SHE WOULD LITERALLY LEAVE THESE TOWNS ABANDONED.
>> KARI LAKE: NO, I WOULD SECURE THE BORDER.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WHY HAVE YOU NOT VISITED THEM AND TALKED TO THEM?
YOU'VE BEEN TO MAR-A-LAGO MORE THAN YOU HAVE TO THE BORDER.
IF YOU TALKED TO THESE TOWN, THE NON-PROFITS, TALK TO THESE MAYOR, THEY WOULD TELL YOU, WE NEED THIS OR THERE WOULD BE CHAOS.
>> KARI LAKE: I'VE BEEN COVERING THIS STATE FOR 30 YEARS, INCLUDING THE BORDER.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: ARIZONA IS GOING TO GET HURT.
>> KARI LAKE: YOU HAVE HURT ARIZONA.
I'VE BEEN TO THE BORDER MORE TIMES -- >> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: WE NEED TO CHANGE TOPICS.
>> SISTER GONG: I'VE BEEN THERE MORE TIMES THAN YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN TO ARIZONA.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: LET'S SWITCH THE TOPIC TO ABORTION.
IF YOU WERE IN THE SENATE, WOULD YOU EITHER VOTE TO MAKE ABORTION -- CODIFY IT IN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, OR WOULD YOU VOTE FOR A BAN?
OR WOULD YOU FIND SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE?
DO YOU THINK FEDERAL OFFICIALS SHOULD BE INVOLVED ON THIS ISSUE AT ALL?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: I WOULD CODIFY ROE.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT THAT MY 15-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER HAS LESS RIGHTS AND IN CONTROL OF HER BODY THAN HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMA.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE NOW GOING INTO SEPSIS JUST TO GET A LIFE-SAVING ABORTION.
WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE TRAVELING WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS THAT ARE VICTIMS, VICTIMS OF RAPE OUT OF STATE SO THEY CAN GET AN ABORTION.
A 10-YEAR-OLD BABY GIRL, VICTIM OF INCEST HAD TO LEAVE HER HOME STATE AND THE COMFORT OF HER FAMILY TO GET AN ABORTION.
AND THE REASON WE NEED TO CODIFY THAT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE KARI LAKE ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE THIS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.
THIS IS A PERSON WHO ONLY TWO YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, SAID THE 1864 TERRITORIAL LAW, A LAW THAT SAID IF YOU WERE AN ABORTION PROVIDER, IT WAS A MANDATORY TWO-YEAR SENTENCE AND HAD NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE OR INCEST, WAS A GREAT LAW.
SHE SAID IT WAS A GREAT LAW.
SHE SAID SHE WAS THRILLED WHEN ROE WAS OVERTURNED.
AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT THE 1864 LAW, AGAIN, THE ONE THAT HAD NO EXCEPTION FOR RAPE OR INCEST, WAS NOT GOING TO GET ENFORCED, SHE SAID, WELL, I HOPE THE SHERIFFS WILL DO THEIR JOBS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE -- >> KARI LAKE: NOT TRUE.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WE HAVE IT ON TAPE.
THESE ARE ALL YOUR WORDS ON TAPE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO ENFORCING ABORTION LAWS?
THIS IS WHO KARI LAKE IS.
SHE HAS TOLD US WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO.
SHE SAID IT.
SHE SAID SHE WAS THRILLED WHEN ROE WAS OVERTURNED.
AND SO DO WE WANT POLITICIANS LIKE KARI LAKE TO BE INVOLVED IN THESE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT DECISION WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE WOMAN, THE DOCTOR AND THE FAMILY.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: MRS. LAKE, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> KARI LAKE: IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE STATE.
EVERYONE KNEW IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND ARIZONA -- AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE WOMEN OF ARIZONA.
I'M THE ONLY WOMAN ON THIS STAGE RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T THINK I'M STANDING NEXT TO A WOMAN.
AND SO I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT THESE CHOICES MAY BE.
AND WE HAVE THE CHOICE AS ARIZONIANS TO DECIDE WHAT OUR ABORTION LAW IS GOING TO BE.
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO US.
WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE IN NOVEMBER WHEN WE CAST OUR BALLOT.
AND RUBEN GALLEGO WANTS TO TAKE THAT CHOICE AWAY FROM US.
HE WANTS TO TAKE IT BACK TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN SOME BACK ROOM WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND DECIDE WHAT OUR ABORTION LAW IS GOING TO BE IN ARIZONA.
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO US.
I WANT THAT TO BE OUR CHOICE.
WHATEVER OUR CHOICE ENDS UP BEING, I WILL RESPECT.
I COME FROM A LARGE FAMILY.
I'M THE YOUNGEST OF NINE, AND WE HAD EIGHT GIRLS, SO I KNOW A LOT ABOUT WOMEN.
I HAVE A DAUGHTER MYSELF.
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CHOICE TO DECIDE WHAT OUR ABORTION LAW IS HERE IN ARIZONA.
HE KNOWS AND STEVE, YOU KNOW THIS AS WELL.
WE'RE RUNNING FOR FEDERAL OFFICE.
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE DECIDED IN THE SENATE.
THIS IS NOT.
AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I WILL NEVER PASS A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, NOR WILL I APPROVE OR VOTE FOR FEDERAL TAX LAWS BEING USED FOR ABORTION.
BUT HERE'S WHAT I WILL DO.
I'M A MOTHER AND CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WOMEN.
BECAUSE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO DESPERATE IN THIS COUNTRY, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO HAVE AN ABORTION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE, LET ALONE TAKE CARE OF A BABY.
I DON'T WANT ANY WOMAN TO MAKE THAT CHOICE BECAUSE SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE BECAUSE RUBEN GALLEGO MAKES OUR ECONOMY PRACTICALLY COLLAPSE.
IT'S ON LIFE SUPPORT RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO PASS THE MOST PRO-FAMILY LEGISLATION.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT UVF IS PROTECTED.
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS HERE THAT ARE HERE BECAUSE OF UVF.
AND I HAVE MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE CHILDREN AND EXPERIENCE THE JOYS OF PARENTHOOD BECAUSE OF UVF.
RUBEN GALLEGO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
HE WANTS ATHLETES TO HAVE TO COMPLETE AGAINST BIOLOGICAL MEN.
>> NOHE GRAF: YOU SAID YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL BAN.
DO YOU STAND BY THAT IF PROPOSITION 139 HERE IN ARIZONA THAT WOULD OVERRIDE OUR STATE BAN, WOULD YOU STILL NOT PURSUE A FEDERAL BAN.
>> KARI LAKE: FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T HAVE A BAN.
WE HAVE A 15-WEEK BAN SIGNED BY BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SIGNED INTO LAW.
WE DON'T HAVE AN ABORTION BAN.
BUT I WILL NOT PASS A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
RUBEN GALLEGO WANTS TO TAKE THE CHOICE AWAY FROM US.
I'M SURPRISED RUBEN GALLEGO KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WOMAN AND A MAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WERE 187 GENDERS.
I HAVE A DAUGHTER OF MY OWN AND MANY NIECES AND NEPHEWS.
HIS VOTES HAVE CAUSED IT TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER, DANGEROUS PEOPLE, TAKING AWAY THE LIVES OF WOMEN.
I CARE ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR OUR DAUGHTERS TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN ATHLETICS.
HE DOESN'T WANT THAT.
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO THE WOMEN WHO WANT HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION POLITICALLY.
I KNOW YOU SPENT $40 MILLION ON ATTACK ADS REGARDING ABORTION.
THINK ABOUT HOW MANY LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED AND HOW MANY WOMEN COULD HAVE BEEN HELPED WITH $40 MILLION.
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE TO HELP MAKE OUR COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE WITH ALL THOSE ATTACK ADS.
>> NOHE GRAF: I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO RESPOND, AND I WANT YOU TO CLARIFY BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WOULD VOTE TO UPHOLD ROE ON A FEDERAL LEVEL.
SO THAT MEANS THAT STATES CAN ONLY INTERVENE IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THAT'S CORRECT.
WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE PROTECTIONS FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.
KARI LAKE ALSO SPOKE WHERE SHE SAID THE 15-WEEK BAN IS GOOD AND IT'S NOT A BAN.
THERE'S ALSO WITHIN THAT CURRENT LAW NO EXCEPTIONS FOR INCEST AND RAPE.
SO AGAIN, WE'RE GOING BACK TO WHAT SHE ORIGINALLY WAS SAYING NOT TOO LONG AGO WHEN SHE SAID THIS VERY RESTRICTIVE LAW THAT HAD NO, NO, NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE OR INCEST, THAT WOULD HAVE JAILED PROVIDERS WAS A GREAT LAW.
SOMEONE THAT WAS WILLING TO LOOK AT A MOTHER AND SAY I KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER WAS RAPED BUT SHE DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ABORTION.
SHE WAS WILLING TO SAY THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO.
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRUST HER?
WE'RE GOING TO TRUST HER NOW?
THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT'S STILL LYING ABOUT WINNING THE 2022 ELECTION.
AND YET WE'RE GOING TO TRUST HER?
SHE'S FAILED THE BASIC TEST OF HONESTY.
WHY WOULD WE TRUST HER WITH OUR DAUGHTERS.
>> KARI LAKE: CAN I JUST RESPOND REAL QUICKLY?
HE ACTS LIKE HE CARES ABOUT US.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE WOMEN OUT THERE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS CHARACTER AND HIS BACKGROUND, HE HAS BEEN HARASSING WOMEN AND BEING DISPARAGING TOWARDS WOMEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN HE WORKED AT CITY HALL, HE HAD A COMPLAINT ABOUT BEING HOSTILE TOWARDS WOMEN.
HE HAD A SEXUAL HARASSMENT FILED AGAINST HIM IN THE LEGISLATURE.
PEOPLE GO CRYING OUT OF HIS OFFICE.
THIS IS A MAN WHO IS PUTTING ON HIS EXTREME MAKEOVER ACT, AND WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND THE SCENES IS NOT SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT WOMEN.
>> NOHE GRAF: WE WANT TO GET SOME SPECIFICS FOR VOTERS BECAUSE YOU DID MENTION THAT YOU HAVE A PLAN TO SUPPORT THOSE CATCH SERVICES.
SO THINGS LIKE STATE FOSTER AND ADOPTIVE SERVICES, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN IN POSTPARTUM CARE.
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO SUPPORT THOSE SERVICES?
>> KARI LAKE: I'M SO GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT.
THAT GETS MENTIONED SO INFREQUENTLY IN THIS DISCUSSION.
THERE'S SO MANY FAMILIES OUT THERE WHO WOULD LOVE TO ADOPT A CHILD.
I JUST SAW A STATISTIC, AND IT BROKE MY HEART.
IT SAID THAT 60% OF WOMEN WHO HAVE AN ABORTION WOULD HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO HAVE ONE IF THEY KNEW THERE WAS FINANCIAL HELP OUT THERE OR EMOTIONAL HELP.
AND SO IF WE WERE JUST OFFERING A LITTLE BIT OF HELP TO WOMEN, THEY WILL CHOOSE TO HAVE THAT BABY.
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CHOICES ARE OUT THERE.
AND A LOT OF THESE YOU MENTIONED ARE STATE PROGRAMS, SO THAT WOULD BE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL.
BUT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ASSIST IN THAT, WE NEED BIGGER FAMILIES.
WE NEED FAMILIES OUT THERE.
OUR BIRTHRATE IS DROPPING TO A PRECIPITOUS LEVEL, ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.
WE CAN'T JUST IMPORT NEW POPULATIONS.
WE WANT TO HAVE FAMILIES GROWING.
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT A CHILD TAX CREDIT, WE HAVE SUPPORT.
YOU KNOW, I JUST BELIEVE DEEPLY IN HOW BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL FAMILIES ARE, COMING FROM A BIG FAMILY MYSELF.
>> NOHE GRAF: THANK YOU.
>> KARI LAKE: WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH, BUT WE HAD LOVE AND A BIG FAMILY IS A REALLY SPECIAL THING.
>> NOHE GRAF: THANK YOU.
MR. GALLEGO, ONE MINUTE.
WOULD YOU TRY TO WORK IN SOMETHING ON A FEDERAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO AFFORD THEIR CHILDREN?
AND IF ANY OF THE STRICTER STATE ABORTION BANS ARE UPHELD?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WELL, CERTAINLY WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE CONTINUE WITH SOME OF THE GREAT WORK WE DID WITH THE CHILD TAX CREDIT.
THAT BROUGHT CHILDHOOD POVERTY DOWN BY 60%, WHICH, BY THE WAY, KARI LAKE WAS AGAINST WHEN THE BILL WAS ON THE FLOOR.
WE SHOULD ALSO MOVE INTO CHILD CARE.
RIGHT NOW, CHILD CARE IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SENDING YOUR KID TO ASU.
THESE ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING AS OFTEN AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING EVERY DAY A LITTLE BETTER.
THERE WAS JUST A LOT OF PERSONAL HITS THAT WERE JUST THROWN THERE.
AND WE WON'T GO THROUGH EVERY LIE, BUT -- >> KARI LAKE: I WOULD ACTUALLY BE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WHAT SHE TALKED ABOUT, WHAT SHE CLAIMS HAPPENED DID NOT HAPPEN.
SHE WE'RE ACTUALLY FRIENDS AND SHE'S SUPPORTING IS THIS CAMPAIGN.
NUMBER TWO, THIS IS A TREND WE'RE GOING TO SEE FROM KARI LAKE, SHE'S GOING TO GO TO ATTACKS BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ON ABORTION.
SHE WAS WILLING TO TELL A MOM, YOUR DAUGHTER WASN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE AN ABORTION IF SHE WAS RAPED JUST TWO YEARS AGO.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE ECONOMY.
MRS. LAKE, I WANT TO ASK YOU A SPECIFIC QUESTION.
I WANT TO GET SOME IDEAS FOR YOU.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA WHO REGARDLESS OF THE STOCK MARKET GOING UP OR UNEMPLOYMENT BEING LOW, THEY'RE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW.
THEY HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS.
WHAT DOES A LIVING WAGE LOOK LIKE TO YOU?
AND HOW WOULD YOU HELP PEOPLE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD HOUSING?
>> KARI LAKE: I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR ARIZONIANS.
THERE'S SO MANY BIG PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW, BUT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING.
I WAS TALKING TO A WOMAN, AND SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE VOLUNTEERS AND SHE'S VOLUNTEERED FOR DECADES AT THE FOOD BANK, GIVING FOOD, VOLUNTEERING HER TIME.
SHE SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I'VE HAD TO GO TO THAT FOOD BANK AND ASK FOR HELP BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, AND THAT STARTS WITH BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF EVERYTHING.
WE'VE BEEN AFFECTED MOST, ESPECIALLY IN RUBEN GALLEGO'S DISTRICT WITH INFLATION.
HOUSING PRICES ARE ON THE RISE.
THEY'VE GONE UP 35%.
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE AND BOUGHT A THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE FOR $88,000, IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE.
AND IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE AMERICA RESCUE PLAN, IT ACTUALLY SENT US SPIRALING AND PUT OUR ECONOMY ON LIFE SUPPORT.
OBAMA'S TREASURY SECRETARY WARNED RUBEN GALLEGO AND THE DEMOCRATS, DO NOT SIGN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTO LAW OR IT WILL SEND INFLATION SKYROCKETING UP.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.
THEY DID NOT HEED THE WARNING.
THEY SIGNED IT INTO LAW AND THAT'S WHY THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP.
THE PRICE OF EGGS UP OVER 100%.
THE AVERAGE MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENT HAS GONE UP 105% HERE IN ARIZONA.
AND WE HAVE THREE CITIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THE HIGHEST JUMP FROM RENT PAYMENTS EVERY SINGLE MONTH, AND THAT'S TUCSON, MESA AND PHOENIX.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO DO IS SECURE THE BORDER.
WHEN YOU HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE AND WE'RE COMPETING FOR GOODS AND SERVICES WITH PEOPLE, IT'S A BASIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF EVERYTHING, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PRINTING MONEY AND BRINGING INFLATION UP.
THERE'S ONLY ONE ENTITY THAT CAN CREATE INFLATION, THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY HAVE PUSHED FOR MORE SPENDING, MORE SPENDING, MORE SPENDING.
AND THAT MEANS MORE PRINTING OF MONEY, AND THAT'S WHY YOUR DOLLAR IS ONLY WORTH 75 CENTS TODAY.
IT WAS WORTH $1 UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S ONLY 75 CENTS UNDER KAMALA HARRIS.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: HOW DO YOU MAKE LIVING MORE AFFORDABLE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: NUMBER ONE, THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE $15.
NUMBER TWO, WE NEED TO STOP THE MERGERS OF GROCERY STORES IN ARIZONA.
IF THERE'S A MERGER, THEY WILL HAVE 70% OF ALL STORES.
THAT WILL RAISE PRICES.
AND WE SAW A LOT OF THE GROCERY STORES ALREADY GOUGING OUR CONSUMERS.
KARI LAKE WENT ON RECORD AND SAID SHE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY GOUGING, EVEN THOUGH THESE EXECUTIVES UNDER OATH SAID THEY DID DO IT.
WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE DOING SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE.
WE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT MANDATES THAT OUR GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATES THE PRICES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
WE CAPPED INSULIN AT $35.
NEXT YEAR, SENIORS ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAPPED AT $2,000.
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE FIGHT THESE BIG CORPORATIONS THAT ARE TAKING UP 1 THURSDAY OF ALL THE HOMES.
BY THE WAY, KARI LAKE WANTS TO ALLOW THEM TO KEEP BUYING THOSE HOMES.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: I NEED A 30-SECOND ANSWER ON THAT.
TRUMP TAX CUTS, WOULD YOU VOTE TO EXTEND THEM?
>> KARI LAKE: YES, I WOULD.
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE MAKEOVER OF OF RUBEN WHEN HE SAYS WE'S FOR THE TAX CUTS.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT MAKING ANYBODY ON SENIOR CITIZEN PAY TAXES ON THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK.
NO MORE TAXES ON TIPS AND NO MORE TAXES ON OVERTIME.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP PRINTS MONEY LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE.
THAT'S WHAT RUBEN GALLEGO, KAMALA HARRIS AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE.
WE'RE GOING TO START CUTTING BACK ON THE WASTEFUL SPENDING OF THE GOVERNMENT.
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS WHAT THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON.
FOR EXAMPLE -- >> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: I GAVE YOU 30 SECONDS.
MR. GALLEGO?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WE NEED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE CLASS PORTION OF THE TAX CUTS.
THE TAX CUTS TO THE CORPORATIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY NEED TO GO UP.
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THEM A BIGGER TAX CUT THAN THEY HAVE.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WE ALSO NEED TO BRING IN A CHILD TAX CREDIT AS PART OF THAT TRUMP TAX CUT.
BUT GIVING MORE TAX CUTS TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND PRICE GOUGING ARIZONIANS AT THE SAME TIME IS WHAT KARI LAKE WILL DO.
>> NOHE GRAF: YOU MENTIONED SOCIAL SECURITY SPECIFICALLY.
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN IT?
BECAUSE ARIZONA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS OF SENIORS AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THIS.
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN SOCIAL SECURITY WITHOUT PRIVATIZING IT?
30 SECONDS, PLEASE.
>> KARI LAKE: I WANT PEOPLE ON SOCIAL SECURITY TO KNOW, YOU HAVE PAID INTO THAT, THAT'S AN INSURANCE BENEFIT YOU'VE PAID INTO AND WE ARE NOT TOUCHING THAT.
RUBEN GALLEGO, KAMALA HARRIS AND THE DEMOCRATS WILL DECIMATE IT.
THEY WANT TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN'T -- THE ABLE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE TO CALL QUALIFY TO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, THEY WANT TO RAISE THAT.
AND THEY ALSO WANT TO TAKE MEDICARE.
HE PROMISED HE WOULDN'T TOUCH MEDICARE, THEY WOULDN'T RUIN MEDICARE AND TOUCH IT AND THEY HAVE.
HE WANTS MEDICARE FOR ALL, WHICH REALLY MEANS MEDICAID FOR ALL.
AND THAT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR ARIZONA FAMILIES.
I HAVE TO MENTION THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES.
HIS VOTE IN THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT ACTUALLY CAUSED MEDICATIONS TO GO UP FOR PEOPLE, 57% INCREASE IN PRICE BECAUSE OF HIS VOTE.
>> NOHE GRAF: I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE TO RESPOND TO THAT AND TALK ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: SURE.
AND THIS HAS BEEN FACT CHECKED.
WE DID NOT RAISE SOCIAL SECURITY.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE'VE INCREASED THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE BY NEGOTIATING FOR DRUGS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, PHARMA HAS TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE COST OF DRUGS TO OUR SENIORS.
THE FACT THAT SHE WANTS TO KEEP THAT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO GO WITH THAT.
SOCIAL SECURITY HAS TO BE SAVED.
I'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE THE AGE OF 14.
THE MONEY I PUT INTO SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE MONEY I'VE EARNED.
MY MOM IS ABOUT TO JOIN THE COMMUNITY, TOO.
SHE'S ABOUT TO BE RETIRED N I WANT HER TO HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY.
AND THERE'S SO MANY ARIZONIANS THAT RELY ON IT.
BUT THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO BE REALISTIC.
WE NEED TO RAISE THE CAP TO $400,000 A YEAR.
THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE SOLVENCY AND PAYOUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 100%, ALL THE WAY TO 2060.
THAT'S HOW WE BRING SECURITY.
THAT'S HOW THIS IS DONE.
THIS HAS BEEN CHECKED BY ECONOMISTS AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS.
>> KARI LAKE: WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THIS?
WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT.
FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW WHO'S RUNNING THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
YOUR FIRST DAY ON THE JOB WAS 10 YEARS AGO.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: I ACTUALLY DO A SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 2100, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE REPUBLICANS NOT STOP THE BILL AND FILLER BUSTER THAT.
I TRY TO WORK ON THINGS.
SHE JUST HAS TALKING POINTS.
>> KARI LAKE: HE'S VOTED WITH KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN.
ARIZONA, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THIS.
HE VOTED WITH THEM 100% OF THE TIME.
HE WANTS TO ACT LIKE HE'S BIPARTISAN.
HE'S THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS.
WHEN WE SCRATCH OUR HEADS AND SAY WHERE ARE THESE IDEAS COMING FROM?
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP YOU.
TWO HOTTEST SUMMERS IN ARIZONA HISTORY.
THERE'S CERTAINLY A CLIMATE DIFFERENCE GOING ON HERE IN ARIZONA.
WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE READY ENOUGH TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY AND WATER HERE IN THE STATE IF, IN FACT, WE DO GET HOTTER.
>> KARI LAKE: I WOULDN'T DO WHAT DEMOCRATS DID WHICH IS TO TAKE A GREAT ENERGY POLICY TRUMP HAD IN PLACE AND DECIMATE IT DAY ONE.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
WE NEED TO REBUILD THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE AND TO DRILL, BABY, DRILL.
I WANT TO LOOK AT ALL SOURCES OF ENERGY.
WE ABSOLUTELY NEED PLENTIFUL ENERGY THAT'S INEXPENSIVE AND RELIABLE.
WE WANT RELIABLE ENERGY.
THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY HAS GONE UP SOME 30%.
I WAS READING AN ARTICLE THE OTHER DAY OF A WOMAN WHOSE A RETIREE WHO HAS TO KEEP HER HOUSE AT 83.
SHE KEEPS THE WINDOWS AND SHADES CLOSED BECAUSE SHE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO COOL HER HOUSE.
WE NEED TO BRING THE PRICE OF ENERGY DOWN.
AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE MOVES THE DEMOCRATS DID RIGHT WHEN THEY ENTERED OFFICE, IT CAUSED A SPIKE IN ENERGY PRICES.
ONLY NOW THEY'RE REALIZING THEY'RE IN TROUBLE AND THEY'RE STARTING TO DRILL ONCE AGAIN.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT US TO BE RELIANT ON FOREIGN ENERGY WITH THE MIDDLE EAST AND VENEZUELA.
THEY DON'T WANT US TO HAVE OUR OWN ENERGY.
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL SOURCES OF ENERGY.
I WANT TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE TO USE.
LIKE I SAID, CHEAP AND RELIABLE.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: MR. GALLEGO, TWO MINUTES TO RESPOND TO THAT.
ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WE HAVE TO FIRST ACCEPT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING.
WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY RESILIENT GRID.
WE NEED TO BRING IN MORE BASE LOAD ENERGY.
THAT HAS TO BE NUCLEAR.
THAT'S THE QUICKEST THING WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MEET ARIZONA NEEDS.
SHE DIDN'T BRING UP WATER, BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE BRING UP WATER INVESTMENTS TO DEAL WITH THE DROUGHT CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE MORE WATER RECLAMATION PROJECTS.
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO CUT 768 ACRE FEET OF WATER.
SOME OF OUR FARMERS ARE GOING TO BE SHUT OFF FROM THAT.
THESE ARE THE REAL THINGS SHE SHOULD BE DOING.
SHE'S IN DENIAL ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
SHE'S STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT THE 2022 ELECTION.
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE.
WILL YOU FINALLY TELL THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, DID YOU WIN OR LOSE THAT ELECTION?
>> KARI LAKE: CAN I TALK ABOUT WATER REALLY QUICKLY?
>> NOHE GRAF: 30 SECONDS TO RESPOND.
PLEASE TALK ABOUT WATER.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
SO 30 SECONDS.
>> KARI LAKE: HE'S HAD 10 YEARS IN CONGRESS.
HE'S DONE.
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 30 YEARS REQUEST POLITICIANS SAYING WE HAVE A WATER CRISIS.
WE ARE IN THE WEST AND NEED TO LOOK AT LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS.
I'M NOT FIGHTING OVER A DROP OF WATER.
WE CAN CONSERVE, BUT WE CAN'T CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT OF OUR CRISIS.
WE'LL HAVE A FOOD CRISIS BEFORE WE HAVE A WATER CRISIS.
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND WORK ON TRUE SOLUTIONS.
PIPING IN FRESH WATER, DESALINATION, BUT FINALLY, ONCE AND FOR ALL, BRINGING IN NEW SOURCES OF WATER TO THE WEST.
THE WEST IS GROWING.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE SCROUNGING OVER WATER.
WE WANT TO HAVE PLENTIFUL WATER SOURCES.
I'M SICK OF WATCHING POLITICIANS LIKE RUBEN DO NOTHING.
>> NOHE GRAF: MRS. LAKE, BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF TIME, AS MR. GALLEGO HAS BROUGHT UP, YOU HAVE BOTH MADE YOUR STANCE ON PREVIOUS ELECTIONS CLEAR.
BUT WE WANT TO KNOW, PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS, AT LEAST IN ARIZONA, IF SOMETHING SEEMS TO GO WRONG EVERY TIME.
SO WHAT SPECIFICALLY CAN BE SUPPORTED IN THE SENATE TO RESTORE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS AND LOSES IN ELECTIONS?
>> KARI LAKE: YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE 2000.
ONE YEAR, THE DEMOCRATS ARE MAD, THE NEXT YEAR, THE REPUBLICANS ARE.
WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS WITH OUR ELECTIONS.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THE PEOPLE IN ARIZONA HAVE BEEN BURNED.
THEY'RE TIRED HEARING ABOUT HICCUPS AND LOOPHOLES AND PROBLEMS THAT HAPPEN ON ELECTION DAY.
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL VOTE COUNTS.
MY OPPONENT WANTS ILLEGAL VOTES COUNT.
HE VOTED AGAINST THE SAVE ACT WHICH WOULD PREVENT ILLEGALS FROM VOTING.
I WANT EVERY LEGAL VOTE TO COUNT.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRAT OR THE MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN OR WHERE MOST OF ARIZONA IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN, I WANT EVERY LEGAL VOTE TO COUNT.
MY SOLUTION WOULD BE LET'S GET BACK TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO WHAT WE USED TO HAVE.
ELECTION DAY, PAPER BALLOTS AND WE KNOW THE RESULTS RIGHT THERE ON THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION.
BUT WE DEFINITELY CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE POURING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY VOTING.
RUBEN WANTS TO GIVE THEM ALL ASYLUM AND WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS NONSENSE AT THE BORDER AND RESTORE OUR COUNTRY.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WHENEVER SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER, SHE GOES TO THE BORDER.
THIS PERSON HAS SHOWN -- >> KARI LAKE: HE -- >> NOHE GRAF: WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: SHE CAUSED HARM AND SHE'S BEEN A LAUGHING STOCK.
SHE HAS 14 LAWSUITS.
SHE'S CURRENTLY SUING TO BE REINSTATED AS GOVERNOR.
SHE CAUSED STEPHEN RICHER, A GOOD REPUBLICAN, TO HAVE TO GO GET PRIVATE SECURITY BECAUSE OF ALL HER THREATS THAT SHE CAUSED UPON HIM TO THE POINT WHERE HE SUED FOR DEFAMATION AND SHE ADMITTED SHE LIED ABOUT HIM.
NOW SHE'S JUST WAITING FOR THE JUDGE TO SAY HOW MUCH SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY HIM.
AND BILL GATES AND CLINT HICKMAN.
SHE JUST ALSO SAID THAT SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF VOTE BY MAIL.
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS KARI LAKE, AGAIN, WHO STILL HAS NOT ACCEPTED THAT SHE LOST THE 2022 ELECTION, SHE'S DANGEROUS TO ARIZONA.
SHE WILL SAY ANYTHING, SHE WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN.
>> NOHE GRAF: 30 SECOND, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ELECTIONS?
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: WHAT WE'VE SEEN SECRETARY OF STATE FONTES, COUNTY SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS COUNTY RECORDER, YOU SHOW LEADERSHIP.
YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS.
YOU WORK IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER TO ACTUALLY INSTILL TRUST.
HAVE PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT THE PROCESS, NOT ACTUALLY DO WHAT KARI LAKE DOES.
SHE EXPLOITS IT.
SHE HAS A NON-PROFIT TO FIGHT THE STEAL, BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE'S BEEN USING THE MONEY FOR.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE'S STILL HOLDING UP THE JUDGE IN TERMS OF DISCOVERY SO HE COULD SEE HOW MUCH SHE OWES STEPHEN RICHER FOR LYING ABOUT THE ELECTION >> KARI LAKE: I'VE NEVER LIED TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA.
I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT RIGHT NOW.
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE WATCHING THE EXTREME MAKEOVER OF RUBEN GALLEGO.
BUT I'VE NEVER LIED TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA.
>> NOHE GRAF: I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET TO YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS, BECAUSE IT IS TIME.
OUR TIME IS UP.
WE WANT TO GET TO YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS.
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT FULL MINUTE TO KEEP US ON TIME, WE WILL POLITELY CUT YOU OFF WHEN WE GET TO THE END OF THE MINUTE.
MR. GALLEGO, YOU DO HAVE THE FIRST CLOSING STATEMENT.
YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.
>> RUBEN GALLEGO: THANK YOU, ARIZONA.
I'M A VERY LUCKY MAN TO BE BORN IN THE BEST COUNTRY OF THE WORLD.
BY ALL ACCOUNTS I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.
MY MOM RAISED US ALONE.
AND THROUGH REAL BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND A REAL WANT TO SUCCEED, I GOT TO WHERE I AM.
AND MY SISTERS, WE HAVE DOCTORS, TEACHERS, BUSINESSWOMEN IN OUR SMALL FAMILY.
AND WE ARE A TRUE STORY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
I WANT EVERY ARIZONIAN TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT AND HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS HERE.
WE HAVE DANGEROUS LEADERS LIKE KARI LAKE WHO WILL LIE TO YOU.
SHE'S STILL LYING TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
SHE'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR VOTE AND DISRESPECTING YOU BY SAYING THAT SHE WON THE 2022 ELECTION.
HOW COULD YOU TRUST SOMEONE LIKE THAT WHO'S WILLING TO LIE TO YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE END?
THIS IS BETTER.
ARIZONA, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS.
AND WE ARE A GREAT STATE THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING GREATER IF WE WORK TOGETHER.
>> NOHE GRAF: THAT'S YOUR TIME.
>> KARI LAKE: THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN TONIGHT.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING YOUR NEXT U.S.
SENATOR AND BRINGING BACK A STRONG, SECURE BORDER, THAT STRONG TRUMP ECONOMY WHERE EVERYBODY WAS DOING BETTER, NO MATTER WHAT COLOR YOUR SKIN, WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU WERE FROM, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY ONCE AGAIN.
WE WANT TO FULLY FUND OUR POLICE.
MY OPPONENT CALLED TO DEFUND THE POLICE WHEN HE WAS MARCHING IN THE BLM RIOTS AND CALLING POLICE OFFICERS RACIST AND ACTUALLY THE BAD GUYS.
THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE.
I WANT EVERY POLICE OFFICER AND THEIR FAMILY TO KNOW.
I FULLY SUPPORT YOU.
WE WILL FULLY FUND THE POLICE.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFE AGAIN AFTER ALL OF THE CRIME THAT'S POURED IN WITH THE OPEN BORDER.
OWN DAY ONE, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WORK TO SECURE THE BORDER.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE CRIMINALS WHO INVADED OUR COUNTRY OUT, AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK THE STRONG, STRIVING COUNTRY.
IF THERE'S ANY KIDDOS WATCHING, I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.
I WANT YOU TO DREAM REALLY BIG.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND AND YOUR AMERICAN DREAM WILL BECOME YOUR REALITY.
>> STEVE GOLDSTEIN: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
>> NOHE GRAF: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE, AND WE THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
