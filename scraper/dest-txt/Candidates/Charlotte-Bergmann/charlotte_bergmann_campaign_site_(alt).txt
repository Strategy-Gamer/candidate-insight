Your Money, Your Voice
We have a problem!
Seventeen years after the current congressman was elected, murders, carjackings, rapes, homelessness, and poverty have skyrocketed. He has neglected a majority of the 50,000 veterans who live in Shelby County. He has neglected us! 
This is the year we put a stop to his corruption and disdain 
for us.
Your donation will help make sure we have the resources need to save the 9th district! An individual can contribute up to a maximum of $3,300 to a candidate pursuing a federal office in 
EACH single election cycle. That means you can give $6,600 to a single candidate in 
an election year; $3,300 during the primary campaign, and another $3,300 more during the 
general election. However, we truly appreciate ANYTHING you can do to help us WIN!

Our problem is the 
		current congressman! We have been sending this man to Washington to 
		represent us for 17 years. He doesn't represent who we are. He doesn't 
		represent our values. His lifestyle doesn't represent who we are. He 
		doesn't represent the kind of life Memphian deserves.  
		He doesn't represent the people who live here according to Section 2 of the 
		Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Of course, every 
		two years, he will show up; make token gestures to get the people's vote, only to almost disappear until the next election. It's time to solve this problem by firing him and send a REAL Memphian to Washington. 
		This man is known as a JOKE in Washington. I represent our values. I represent the future for 
							every boy and girl growing up in Memphis. I 
							represent the kind of lifestyle and prosperity we want to 
							have for every Memphian. It's time to send a problem solver to Washington. 
							It's time to send me, Charlotte Bergmann to 
							Washington to represent you.

Law and Order Charlotte is a native Memphian, growing up in a Christian household of ten 
children under the guidance of her parents. Her father was a Baptist minister 
who instilled in his children the true blessings of scripture. Ms. Bergmann was the first in her family to receive a higher level college education. She 
graduated locally from State Technical Institute of Memphis (STIM) in 1986. Charlotte served as president of Phi Theta 
							Kappa Honor Society in 1985-86. She graduated from Christian Brothers University in 1992 with 
a BS, Technology degree. Afterwards, she earned the prestigious, FedEx Sponsored 
Certification of Information System Management (CISM) degree in 1996. Post 
graduation she was employed at FedEx as an Information Technology 
Project Manager. After her long tenure with FDX, Charlotte became self-employed which allowed her 
to spend time on Capitol Hill in Washington DC as a member of the RNC's 
President Club under President George W. Bush. She learned how our government 
works and became interested in politics with a desire to make real changes. In 2018, Charlotte was awarded the Statesmen of the Year Award from the State 
Republican Party. She was then elected to the Tennessee State Executive 
Committee for TN District 33. Since 2010 Ms. Bergmann has also been a Radio and TV Commentator on Informed 
Sources both on local TV Channel 3 news and KWAM 990 AM radio. In July of 2019, Charlotte released her new book, The Last Trumpet, describing 
how we are in a Battle for America, and that we need to debunk the lies and 
miss-truths of the Left and that we must think for ourselves. This is especially 
true to gain independence and to be set free from the cycle of dependency. Ms. Bergmann has since been on speaking tours and presented at prestigious 
assemblies of the Rotary Club, and Kiwanis of TN to name only a few. She has 
held positions as TN VP of Kiwanis and is active in SCRWC (Shelby County 
Republican Woman's Club). Charlotte is a strong Christian woman with strong convictions. She is a fighter, 
and is willing to answer the call to fight for those fellow, hardworking 
citizens whose voices have been drowned out by liberal policies. They are truly 
deserving of so much more. Charlotte Bergmann is a proud supporter of the America First philosophy and 
wants to continue the fight to Keep American Great, especially in her hometown 
city of Memphis, Tennessee. Please help Charlotte raise the funds needed to 
							represent TN 9th District and to reclaim Greater Memphis, Shelby, and Tipton County, one neighborhood at a time.

Memphis sits at the very heart of the United States 
						commerce. We're on the Mississippi river. The major 
						railroads and highways  run through here. The major 
						airport hubs run through here. We have the potential to 
						be a great city. But Steve Cohen is a joke in Congress, 
						who has nothing better to do with his time, than to eat 
						KFC on the floor of Congress. We deserve better. I WILL DO BETTER FOR YOU.

Charlotte Bergmann , the 9TH District (Western) 
							Tennessee congressional candidate, received 
							confidence from the community that she is the 
							Republican to unseat Steve Cohen.  She defeated 
							Cohen in the new redistricted area of Tipton County 
							and she defeated Republican opponent with a 
							resounding amount of support from the Republican 
							Primary voters.
-Lower crime in Memphis: Under Cohen's 16- year 
							reign, Memphis 
							is the most dangerous city in the nation! He 
							sponsors legislation that wants to limit the 2nd 
							amendment and take guns out of law-abiding 
							citizens'' hands. Charlotte is a gun owner and fully 
							supports the 2nd amendment. She is a police 
							supporter and vehemently rejects the "Defund the 
							Police" movement. Charlotte will also strive to 
							improve the judicial process by supporting 
							constitutionalist judges and enforcement of our 
							laws. Ms. Bergmann's commitment to strengthening the 
							judicial process was due to her grandson's murder in 
							2019. The killer was released on a technicality. She 
							is indeed a law and order candidate!
-Increase Memphis Economic Prosperity: Elected 
							Candidate Bergmann will help  get the national and 
							local economy going again by supporting less 
							regulation and lower taxes. For Memphis 
							specifically, she will work to tap into The Opportunity Zone Initiative to spur private and 
							public investment in our under-served community. She 
							will actively work with city officials to promote 
							Memphis to bring in a broad range of companies 
							looking to relocate to a business friendly 
							environment.
-Enhance Memphis Labor Force: In order to draw 
							businesses, Charlotte knows we must develop a better, 
							more educated and skilled labor force. She is 
							pro-school choice, where parents can make their own 
							decisions about their child's education. She is for 
							educational options since everyone learns 
							differently. She will also work to put vocational 
							classes back in the high schools.
To this end, Charlotte would promote and extend 
							after high school trade school options. She 
							would work to secure wide-spread meaningful 
							internship programs with a broad variety of 
							businesses and trades. She would also work with 
							local organizations to increase meaningful 
							mentor-ship programs.
-Improve Healthcare: She will work in Congress 
							on healthcare reform that will lower 
							premiums, lower prescription costs, and increase 
							elderly and Veteran care. In Memphis, Charlotte 
							will fight to ensure that our veterans are given 
							what they need. Under Steve Cohen, our Veterans 
							Hospital care has earned the LOWEST rating for three 
							years in a row. Memphis is one of ONLY 5 VA 
							hospitals with this low ranking for this long period 
							of time.
1) The 
							Republican base is fired up: No doubt we will 
							have high Republican turnout for this important 
							election. Republicans will rightly vote right down 
							the ballot for Charlotte Bergmann.
2) Charlotte 
							has built up name recognition: By being involved 
							in political campaigns in the past, Charlotte has 
							tirelessly worked to get her name and beliefs out to 
							the public.
3) Charlotte 
							served on  a state-wide seat on the TN State 
							Election Committee: She proved she had name 
							recognition and could pull votes in the 9th 
							district.
4) Voice 
							for the Shelby County black community: She will 
							represent a huge number of citizens that are 
							currently underrepresented by the left-wing radical, 
							socialist party. She has been especially 
							instrumental in encouraging the black community to 
							be vigilant and speak out. She participated in the 
							filming of the documentary Runaway 
							Slave in 2011. The heroes of this black 
							conservative film speak out and expose the economic 
							slavery of the black community to the big government 
							progressive policies. Ms. Bergmann continually 
							addresses the false claims of democrats and the 
							liberal media. In her book, The 
							Last Trumpet,, she describes how we must battle 
							for America and seek freedom from the cycle of 
							dependency. She has personally adopted many of 
							Frederick Douglass' philosophies and views for 
							independence and self-responsibility.
Frederick Douglass once said, " I 
							prayed for twenty years, but received no answer 
							until I prayed with my legs." Ms. Bergmann 
							walked away from the Democratic Party in 1992. Now 
							Charlotte will stand up and march to 
							the U.S. House and turn Memphis red!

Why Is This The Republicans Best Chance To Flip This 
							Democrat Congressional Seat?
Charlotte is VERY 
							committed to the following key Community Issues:
The candidate who spends the most money usually wins.
"Money changes everything."  And nowhere is 
							that statement taken to heart more than in a federal 
							election, where billions of dollars are raised and 
							spent on the understanding that money is a crucial 
							determinant of whether or not a candidate will win.
First, it's clear that money counts in elections. The average 
winner in contests for House seats has outspent the average loser by at 
least $310,000, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign 
Finance Institute.
An individual can contribute $3,300 at most to a candidate for federal office in 
a single election cycle. That means you can give $6,600 to a single candidate in 
an election year: $3,300 during the primary campaign, and $3,300 more during the 
general election.

Memphis has become renowned for being the 'Most Dangerous City in the U. 
		S.' Applying a bandaid remedy to solve our crime problems has become a 
		non-issue. Immediate measures must be implemented. In the 1990s the 'Broken Window' strategy was issued by New York City 
		Police Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani. This 
		strategy states that visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior, and 
		civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime 
		and disorder, as well as serious crimes. Its purpose helped to create an 
		atmosphere of order and lawfulness by improving policing methods that 
		target minor crimes, such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, and 
		fare evasion. Currently, Memphis' Justice Department is not prosecuting criminals to 
		the satisfaction of the community, which is essential to remove our 
		'Most Dangerous City in the U.S.' status. Criminals are released quickly 
		after arrests and are given low or no bail. This practice distresses our 
		local residents and cautions tourists to hesitate even visiting Memphis. 
		New business opportunities, as well, hesitate to come into an 
		environment that will be a losing proposition for their company. Memphis should: 1) Hold our police force to a high standard of professional conduct. 2) Restore monies the Democrats ripped away in their effort to defund 
		the police. 3) Hold criminals and would-be criminals accountable. Once I become a member of Congress, my main goal will be to address 
		crime and provide officers indemnity at the federal level so they can 
		perform their duties without ambulance lawyers bankrupting our city 
		while protecting repeat criminals. I am very cognizant of crime in Memphis. One of my grandsons was 
		murdered over a girl by a criminal who picked up his casing after 
		shooting him in the back before jumping into his vehicle. Even though there were witnesses, he was 
		released shortly after the incident and has never paid for this crime. These murders can be reduced if our police are allowed to do their jobs 
		in order to bring safety and pride back to Memphis. I support our 
		police. I hope and pray you will support me on election day.
