Crowd ( 05:17 ):
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Speaker 1 ( 05:52 ):
All right. Time for a little convention business here. The Chair states that in compliance with Rule 40(b), the Chair has been furnished with evidence that a plurality of the delegates from each of five or more states severely support the candidate who will be presented for the nomination for Vice President of the United States. The Chair would like to remind delegates of the provisions of Rule 40(a), which provide that in part, if there is only one candidate for nomination for Vice President of the United States, who has demonstrated the support required by this paragraph (b) of this rule, a motion to nominate for such office by acclamation shall be in order, and no calling of the roll with respect to such office shall be required. At this time, the Chair states that she has been furnished with evidence that there is only one candidate for nomination for the Office of Vice President, who has demonstrated the support required under Rule 40(b) of the Rules of the Convention.
Speaker 5 ( 06:55 ):
And I trust you, J.D.
Speaker 1 ( 06:56 ):
Delegates and alternates, the Chair recognizes and is pleased to introduce John Husted, Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, for the purpose of nominating. Please give him a warm welcome.
John Husted ( 07:18 ):
Are we ready?
Speaker 7 ( 07:19 ):
We love J.D.
John Husted ( 07:20 ):
Are we ready to nominate a vice president?
Crowd ( 07:25 ):
John Husted ( 07:25 ):
How about you, Ohio?
Crowd ( 07:27 ):
John Husted ( 07:30 ):
That’s awesome. I’m John Husted, the Lieutenant Governor from the great State of Ohio. It’s an honor to speak to you all this afternoon to formally nominate the Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States.
Speaker 8 ( 07:52 ):
J.D. J.D. J.D.
John Husted ( 07:59 ):
Ohio is the heart of it all, and that is certainly the case once again here today. The vice presidency is an office of sacred trust. The man who accepts this nomination accepts with it the awesome responsibility to give wise counsel to the president, to represent America abroad, to preside over the Senate, and to be ready to lead our nation at a moment’s notice. Such a man must have an America first attitude in his heart.
Speaker 9 ( 08:35 ):
John Husted ( 08:36 ):
Amen. He must embrace his obligation to the American family, the American worker, and the American soldier. He must believe that America is exceptional and be prepared in the tradition of our founders to pledge his life, his fortune, his sacred honor, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. He must share the values and principles of our presidential nominee and be trusted to faithfully implement the will of the people. J.D. Vance is such a man.
Crowd ( 09:40 ):
J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D.
John Husted ( 09:52 ):
A man who loves America and will represent our people with moral courage, strength, and honor, J.D. is a living embodiment of the American dream. He came from humble beginnings, and even as his life took him to places he might have never imagined, he never forgot where he came from. Ohio values are in his blood.
( 10:23 ) He served our nation in the United States Marine Corps. He is a graduate of the Ohio State University. He graduated summa cum laude from Yale Law School, and is the author of the best-selling book, Hillbilly Elegy. And he is a crusader for the people of the Ohio in the United States Senate. He has never forgotten the working people of our country, and he never will. He fought to bring investment to Middle America as a businessman, and has fought to defend them every single day in the Senate. And this I know, this I know, he will faithfully stand by President Donald Trump’s side as they win this election and change the course of our nation.
Speaker 3 ( 11:40 ):
John Husted ( 11:41 ):
They will change the course of our nation to the benefit of all American citizens and truly make our country great again. It is therefore my honor to nominate Ohio Senator J.D. Vance for the office of Vice President of the United States of America.
Crowd ( 12:04 ):
J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D.
Speaker 10 ( 12:05 ):
We love you, J.D.
J.D. Vance ( 12:05 ):
I love you too, [inaudible 00:12:30].
Speaker 3 ( 12:25 ):
Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1 ( 12:30 ):
Delegates and alternates, pursuant to Rule 40(a), a motion to nominate by acclamation is now in order. The Chair now recognizes Delegate Bernie Moreno, senate candidate from Ohio, for the purpose of making a motion.
Bernie Moreno ( 12:45 ):
Thank you, Madam Chair. My name is Bernie Moreno. I’m honored to be the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from the great State of Ohio. I know firsthand that my dear friend, J.D., is a selfless and brilliant fighter. He is a patriot who loves America. He loves Ohio. He loves his family. He’s a great father, he’s a great man, and that’s what we need in this nation today.
( 13:18 ) To J.D. Vance, America First is not just a slogan, it’s his North Star. He has followed it every moment of his life and career. He knows what it’s like to live in poverty, forgotten by Washington politicians. He is dedicated to ensure that no American is ever forgotten again. Madam Chair, it is a great honor to move that J.D. Vance be nominated by acclamation by this Republican National Convention as its candidate for the Office of Vice President of the United States of America.
Speaker 1 ( 14:13 ):
Without objection, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion that Senator J.D. Vance be nominated by acclamation. All those in favor signify by saying, “Aye.”
Crowd ( 14:26 ):
Speaker 1 ( 14:27 ):
All those opposed signify by saying, “No.” In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the motion is adopted. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
Crowd ( 14:38 ):
J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D. J.D.
Speaker 1 ( 14:48 ):
