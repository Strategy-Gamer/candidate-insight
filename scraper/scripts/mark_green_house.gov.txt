Learn about Congressman Mark Green’s top priorities for serving the constituents of Tennessee’s 7th District.
As a physician, I know firsthand that life begins at conception, and it’s our moral responsibility to protect the most vulnerable among us.
Education should be completely controlled by states and local governments, not the federal government. K-12 education is the future of our country. The federal Department of Education has no business in our children’s education and should give up its power and transfer it back to the states.
After my service in the Army, I founded an emergency department staffing company that grew to over $200 million in annual revenue. I also founded two medical clinics that provide free healthcare to under-served populations in Tennessee. I know that if we put free-market principles back into healthcare, we can lower the cost of care and alleviate the burden on American consumers.
I know from my experience fighting the War on Terror that Israel is our unwavering ally in the Middle East. A strong and robust relationship between Israel and America is critical.
I served more than two decades in the Army, with three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. I understand the global challenges the United States faces firsthand.
To boost and feed a strong economy, the federal government needs to get out of the way by decreasing taxes and regulations.
Simply, we must follow the U.S. Constitution.
Legal immigration is necessary for the continued strength of our economy. However, illegal immigration threatens the safety of individual Americans and the financial strength of the country.
At over $29 trillion today, our national debt is perhaps the greatest threat to our children and grandchildren’s future. We don’t have a revenue problem in America—we have a spending problem.
Having worn the uniform for 24 years, and now with a son in the Army, no one will fight for our veterans more than I will. That's why the first bill I introduced in Congress was a pro-veteran bill. The Protecting Gold Star Spouses Act ensures spouses continue receiving benefits during government shutdowns.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Rep. Green’s Bipartisan Bill Protecting Shooting Sports Signed Into Law
WASHINGTON—Today, Rep. Mark Green released the following statement after President Biden signed his Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act into law:
Green said, “I appreciate the President signing this bill into law. Today, politics was put aside, and our children are the real winners. Student athletes deserve to take part in shooting sports without fear of their programs losing funding. If there’s anything both sides of the aisle can unite on, it’s protecting students’ ability to get involved in school programs that foster an appreciation for nature and benefit their development.”
“I hope Americans see the incredible outpouring of support for our student athletes,” continued Green. “Life-changing opportunities come from participating in these programs—and our children are better because of it.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Rep. Mark Green Condemns $2.3 Trillion Spending Bill & Broken Legislative Process
WASHINGTON—Tonight, Rep. Mark Green issued the following statement on the irresponsibly bloated $2.3 trillion backroom pork barrel spending bill passed by the House:
“Since September, Speaker Pelosi has refused to negotiate in good faith with Republicans to fund the government. Now, facing another self-inflicted shutdown, she once again forces a massive spending bill down our throats. I think every American can agree they would like their Member of Congress to have more than six hours to read a 5,593 page, $2.3 trillion bill before voting to bankrupt our children and grandchildren.”
“We have been fighting this pandemic for almost a year. We know that broad one-size-fits-all solutions do little to contain its spread or mitigate its effects. That’s why I’ve argued for months that any relief needs to be targeted—much like containment measures. We have once again failed the American people. It’s time to do better. It’s time for new leadership.”
