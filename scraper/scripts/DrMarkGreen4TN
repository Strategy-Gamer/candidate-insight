Not only did President Biden call half of the country garbage, but his staff overruled non-partisan stenographers to change the transcript.

This is some Orwellian-level lying. Luckily the American people can see right through it.

To put it simply, the Harris-Walz ticket wants more economic centralization and less of the free market.

There is no doubt that Harris‚Äô radical economic policies would hurt our economy.

Our Founders knew what they were doing when they implemented a system of checks and balances.

It‚Äôs frightening to see that VP Kamala Harris wants to destroy this system just because the Supreme Court would stand in her way of implementing radical progressive policies.

While President Trump has vowed to enact universal school choice, Harris and Walz would surely tighten the hold of teachers unions and the Department of Education on K-12 education. Our country needs more education freedom, not less.

2024-10-07T18:00:16.000Z
It may not always be easy, but we must constantly strive to be active defenders of liberty. As the late and great President Reagan once said: ‚ÄúFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.‚Äù

2024-10-05T16:30:10.000Z
Vice President Harris‚Äôs tax plan would negatively impact the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Americans. It is not the solution to the economic crisis she and President Biden caused.

2024-10-04T20:19:03.000Z
If we want to get our economy back on track, we need to stop spending billions of dollars on radical climate programs and support domestic energy production.

2024-10-03T14:30:09.000Z
The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs CHNV program should have been permanently terminated. Are we supposed to believe that this temporary pause somehow eradicated the issue of widespread fraud?

https://t.co/fn2xpuNi8Y

2024-10-02T17:00:18.000Z
Despite rampant inflation, the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs bureaucracies are implementing new regulations that will drive up the cost of energy. Tennesseans don‚Äôt want a radical climate agenda‚Äîwe want to be able to afford our utility bills.

https://t.co/pwDO57aPvs

2024-10-02T01:32:33.000Z
America cannot handle 4 more years of crushing inflation. If we elect far-left candidates to office this November, that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre going to get.

VP Harris‚Äôs mass parole programs are a complete and utter disaster. This administration clearly has no interest in enforcing the laws passed by Congress and securing our country‚Äôs borders.

The average Tennessee household has spent an additional $26,341 due to inflation since the Biden-Harris administration took office. 

Keep that in mind on election day.

2024-09-11T02:34:36.000Z
Since President Biden and VP Harris took office, Tennesseans are paying an additional $123 for energy and $276 for transportation each month due to inflation. VP Harris‚Äôs radical climate agenda will only exacerbate these costs.

Vice President Kamala Harris was the last person in the room when President Biden decided to withdraw from Afghanistan. Although she could have stopped this disastrous withdrawal, she felt ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with President Biden‚Äôs decision.

2024-09-11T02:18:30.000Z
Reminder: The Biden-Harris administration left the Taliban $7 billion of U.S. military equipment during its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

2024-09-11T01:45:39.000Z

When President Trump was in the White House, there wasn‚Äôt chaos at our Southwest border and our country wasn‚Äôt over $35 trillion in debt. If we want to preserve liberty for future generations, we need to re-elect President Trump.

The Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs botched withdrawal from Afghanistan cost the lives of 13 U.S. servicemembers.

Under the Trump administration, our borders were secure and Americans were safer. Unlike the current administration, President Trump understands that border security is national security.

2024-09-11T01:27:34.000Z
VP Harris shares culpability for creating the worst border crisis in our nation‚Äôs history. Border security hasn‚Äôt been her priority over the past ~4 years, nor will it ever be.
