Where are the sanctions? Where is the outcry from the left? Where is ANY action from this admin?

Biden and Harris love to talk about freedom, but what have they done to stop Maduro and defend the freedom fighters who bravely voted for change?

Benefits? Tell that to the families of Laken Riley &amp; Rachel Morin. Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Americans fatally poisoned by fentanyl that‚Äôs crossed your WIDE OPEN BORDER.

The only benefits are to illegals, cartels, gangs &amp; smugglers. You‚Äôve left Americans behind. https://t.co/BRHI233zC6

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is a socialist.

Team Scott was happy to share the message in Miami last night.

Floridians rejected her once and they‚Äôll do it again in November. https://t.co/NzUH9MfeRW

Not only is the Biden/Harris border crisis affecting the safety of our communities, it‚Äôs costing taxpayers BILLIONS.

With President @realDonaldTrump back in the White House, and Republican majorities in the House and Senate, we will put an end to the crisis on Jan 20, 2025. https://t.co/igZWpMXvWn

My opponent recently blamed PM Netanyahu for Hamas continuing to hold Americans hostage.

Why is she¬†afraid of her pro-terrorist base?

Migrant charged in brutal beating of NYC cops had been caught at border ‚Äî and released ‚Äî last year.

But remember ‚Äì our Border Czar Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt believe that people who cross our border illegally are guilty of any crime. https://t.co/S8YreW5iYC

People are sick and tired of this lawfare the Dems are using against President @realDonaldTrump.

They know they can‚Äôt beat him at the ballot box, so they‚Äôre trying to come at him through the courts.

The American people won‚Äôt fall for it. https://t.co/zqkgDWz2ba
