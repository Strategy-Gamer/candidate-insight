Every Memorial Day weekend for more than 60 years my parents have visited the graves of our ancestors across Western PA to pay our respects to them and to many veterans.

We are suffering from high costs because of his and Bob Casey‚Äôs excessive spending.

Of the ~50 illegal immigrants I witnessed crossing our southern border, a handful were military-aged men from Syria and a handful were Chinese nationals.

And that‚Äôs just what I saw with my own eyes.

#1 ‚Äì Whole milk in PA schools is a no-brainer.

During this tour, dairy farmers told me that Washington‚Äôs ban hurts their livelihoods &amp; our kids. I'll stand with PA's 5,000 dairy farmers ‚Äî not work against them like Bob Casey.

Here's why: https://t.co/Zvc6994POs

@DonaldJTrumpJr As the father of daughters, I can‚Äôt imagine my girls being required to share a locker room or a playing field with biological men. 

Out of touch Bob Casey says these concerns are ‚Äúunfounded.‚Äù 

Unacceptable. Some things are just basic right vs. wrong.

All 24 employees on the rig are Pennsylvanians and the operation is a critical source of revenue for the county.  

But Biden's LNG ban is hurting PA businesses like Beech while degrading our environment.

Bob Casey claims he's "always" protected American workers.
