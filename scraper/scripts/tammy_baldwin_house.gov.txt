Thank you for visiting my website. My website collects no personal information about you when you visit the site unless you choose to provide that information during your visit so that I can contact you about an issue you have raised or help you with a problem.
Protecting the personal privacy of individuals who use the Internet is very important to me.  I appreciate the opportunity to describe to you below the policies I have put in place to safeguard the privacy of individuals who visit my website and contact my office. If you have questions or concerns about my privacy policy, or any other issues involving the Internet, I would like to hear from you and hope you will contact me by using this online form , or by telephone or postal mail, to let me know your thoughts.
My website is not set up to collect any personal information about you when you visit the site unless you choose to provide that information to my office. My website has an online web form that you can use to contact me by sending an electronic message expressing your views or concerns or asking for assistance with a particular problem involving a federal agency. To send me a message, the online web form asks you for your name, address, email address, and preferred telephone number. I use this information provided by you to contact you about the matter you expressed your views about and to provide any casework assistance I can regarding problems you may be experiencing in dealing with a federal agency. This information will be available to members of my staff so they can help me in responding to your message or request.
If you are requesting help with a problem involving a federal agency, it is necessary for my office to obtain a completed Privacy Act Release form from you.  Federal agencies subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 are prohibited from releasing personal information without consent from the individual.  Therefore, my office must obtain your written consent so that the relevant federal agency can communicate with me about your concerns.  A Privacy Act Release form is generated through my website when you request help with a federal agency. You can print, sign and mail that form to my office.  My staff would also be happy to postal mail you a Privacy Act Release form to complete if that would be helpful.
This website also allows you to sign up to receive electronic news updates from my office. My office will not share nonpublic information with persons outside the Senate, other than to address constituent casework at your request, or in connection with a legal proceeding or potential investigation, or if the communications are potentially unlawful, or suggest a risk to health or safety.
My office collates comments concerning legislation and government policy issues so that I will be fully informed about the views of constituents. From time to time I come across comments made by constituents via email, postal mail, phone call, or fax that I feel powerfully illustrate a need for action.  Such comments make a point of Wisconsinites’ interest that I may like to refer to in a speech, include in the Congressional Record, or make use of in connection with debate in the Senate or by sharing with a relevant governmental agency. If your comments are utilized, I will not publicly share your full name without your permission. My staff will also make every effort in such cases to contact you first. If you intend your message to be confidential, and would prefer that it not be used in such a way, please feel free to advise me of your preference in the message.
For all United States Senate websites, the Senate collects information for site management and site security purposes.  To learn more about the Senate’s Internet security and privacy policies, please click here .
My website has links to other useful sites on the Internet, including sites of other government agencies. If you follow any link that takes you to a location that does not include 'senate.gov' in the address, you will have left the Senate web server and you will need to refer to that site's own privacy policy.
